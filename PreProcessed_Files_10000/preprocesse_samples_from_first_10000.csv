Creating new rows for listed substrings,|My goal is to create a wordcloud in R, but I'm working with nested JSON data (which also happens to be incredibly messy). There's a nice explanation here for how to create a wordcloud of phrases rather than singular words. I also know melt() from reshape2 can create new rows out of entire columns. Is there a way in R to perform a melt-like function over nested substrings? Example:...should become:...where each subsequent substring is returned to the next row. In my actual data, the pattern c("x, y") is consistent but the substrings are too varied to know a priori.If there's no great way to do this, too bad... just thought I'd ask the experts!|,<r>

Hosting Access on Server,|What is the draw back of hosting the front end of my database on a server?I'm trying to get an access database ready for deployment. I have around 50 users.

In today's age distributing copies of a front end seems ridiculous. I'd like to host a copy of the front end on a server that users can navigate to and launch instead. Is this a feasible option?

How to summarize the elements in a complex object?,|I have a very complex S4 object (output from a lavaan model) which has slots within slots within slots and variables ($) at the deepest level of each of the deepest slots. How do I extract and store the object.size(and potentially other functions like length and dim and the object name) of every element within this object so that I can compare it to another object of the same class?I have tried storing the output from str(obj) and unclass(obj) and then manipulating the output to extract the information I want, but it's turning out to be very tedious. Looping over names is equally difficult. Is there a way to "flatten" the object into a list? Is there a recursive function anyone can think of to repeatedly dig into each slot?EditHere's an example, using the lavaan package I referenced above, though ideally the solution shouldn't be dependent on the specific object class and could work across classes:The object fit contains many slots and objects inside. I can, of course, extract information from a particular element like object.size(fit@Data@X[[1]]), but I'm looking for a generalized solution. The challenge is that I want to extract the same information about each element, regardless of its "depth".Thanks!|,<r>

Now, at any given time there is going to be a value in one of the 'scheme' columns - I need excel to automatically or by macro calculate the appropriate value into the other cells.For example, there are three assignments each marked with a different scheme on the same sheet. How can I get excel to check which mark value exists and then populate/calculate the other two the corresponding values. Mike got 80% (%) on Assignment 1, but I want excel to populate the level column and letter column with the corresponding values at the same time Level 3 on Assignment 2 excel to calculate corresponding percentage and letter and at the same time for a Letter A on Assignment 3 the corresponding % and level should be calculated. Don't know if this is possible or makes sense, but I tried VLOOKUP and was not successful because I have to do it all manually - I'm aiming for an automated process.Sorry if it is not clear or confusing...but I've been at this for two days with no luck and not even sure if what I'm doing is possible.|,<excel><vba><macros><formula><calculation>
Netlogo - Controlling specific sets of turtles,|I am trying to develop a model to demonstrate a field principle I am trying to work with. I am having trouble finding information on how to control specific groups of turtles. Essentially I would like to make a grid of turtles and links that I can distort, relative to an objective coordinate grid, based upon the placement of a different type of turtle, like a particle interacting with a field?Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Is it possible to write a command that only talks to specific turtles by their who value? for instance if i had a coordinate plane that went from -3,3 in both x and y, rendering 49 vertices, could I set up those first 49 turtles, and then spawn my particle turtles (lets say 3), which would be who 49,50, and 51. could I write a command specifically for those 3 turtles based upon their relations to the first 49 turtles?I hope this question makes sense.|,<netlogo>
How to get root element for scope in angular?,|I usually need the element's scope which is something like $(element).scope() or angular.element(..).scope()But now I have the opposite problem - I have a scope, and I need to find which element generated it. How can I find out from the developers' console which element it is? Why do I need this?I am working on someone else's code, fixing a bug. I am still trying to figure out some stuff, but some of the code is quite hard to follow. Very generic and a lot of copy-paste, so searches don't always help. There's a lot of ng-includes and directives that use the parent scope. There's a view calling a service somehow - it is unclear how yet.. I do have a reference to a scope, which is different from the one in the view that triggers the function. So if I find the element from which that scope came from, it could sort out the relation between them etc.. At least give me some lead. Obviously some refactoring and best practices are required in the future, but I have to focus on this bug first. |,<angularjs>

Taking minimum value of neighboring cells,|I'm trying to write a function that takes receives some matrix[N][M] (N and M are defined at the beginning and they're both always 3), two integers and returns the smallest value of neighboring cells (horizontally, vertically and diagonally) to that specific (y,x) cell (The function is part of a larger code that takes specific (y,x)s and not any (y,x). it is called in some specific cases) in a 2D array - Minimum(int mat[N][M], int y, int x).Say for example I have the 2D array and I'm looking specifically at the 0,0 element1 10 918 9 1019 10 8I want that cell to change to 9 since its the smallest value of the neighboring cells (the cell itself doesn't matter if it's the minimum of them all or not) so the array becomes9 10 918 9 1019 10 8What I tried: First I went over each neighboring cell.

I tried a lot of conditions and none worked.Another thing I thought of and tried implementing was adding a 1D array that stores the values of the all the neighboring cells (if there are less than the size of the array - store 0) and then checking the minimum between every two cells excluding the 0s.

GUI Game of Checkers Has an Error I Cant Possibly Fix,|This is a simple game of checkers with red X's on the bottom as player one and black O's at the top as player 2.All the commands for moving the pieces are working correctly, but colors might be a bit off (I can fix that).During the game, most jumps work properly except one thing.If there is an O on the right of the X piece, if i decide not to jump over the O and move to the left, the X moves to the corresponding spot, but the O disappears. The same problem with the other side.This part of the code is basically the main movements and code for the game.Basically, if a button turns green, variable whichClick=2 or 3 or 4 depending on the situation. If i click on the green button, it will run the code to move/eat depending what whichClick is equal to. You can see a pattern, b[a-9], b[a-7], b[a-14], b[a-18]. These allow the piece to move in the diagonal motion. Ex. If b[a-9] is occupied by the opposite piece, b[a-18] will light up green as a place to move and so on.Player 2 code is almost the same, but minuses are pluses, and numbers are changed slightly.The problem is, as player one, if b[a-7] is occupied by O and I decide not to eat it but play to the space b[a-9] which is on the left, the O disappears. If I decided to jump over it, it successfully plays properly. Now, if b[a-9] is occupied, jumping over doesn't eat it.I checked the code for any mistakes hundreds of times but still cannot seem to see where the error is. Do you see any errors in my code?

Photon Server vs Dedicated Master Client with PUN,|(Sorry for long looking post, It is actually really short in context)Hello, I am new in network programming and concepts. However I have worked with PUN before, several times. I am familiar with PUN way of synchronizing things. RPC and Serialization etc.I want to achieve a full-authoritative and future scalable server architecture that works in dedicated servers and manages room/lobby services for clients. The server architecture that I am planing is, similar to the games like Rust/ARK/Hurtworld etc. However the game will consist 7v7 matches, (not 100ish like them, 15 max), but will also have mechanics that alters the world. (like building something to world or altering terrain by mining etc). Gameplay would resemble Rust in visuals, but the mechanics would differ. However server architecture should be very similar to those games. Meaning it won't be Peer to Peer.To start: "I know" that I have to use Photon Server for these type of things. So I can code server side logic right? The authoritative architecture, the persistent world, user&amp;world databases, server management all these should be done in the server side if I am not mistaken. However as i said in the beginning I have only worked with PUN before, and only client-server architecture I know is that: one trusted client (user) hosts the game and others joins to him.Now. I can learn Photon Server and server side programming. (hell, even started learning it now. It is kinda similar how PUN does it's work. Operations and Events instead of RPC's etc.) However, to create a sustained server architecture, I have to learn and practice it in depth. Meaning: I need profound knowledge to create a commercial product server.So for the initial prototyping phase of the game, I don't want to focus my workload to learning and creating the Photon Server. Instead I have come up with an idea.What if I create Unity instances in dedicated servers, that creates(hosts) rooms with PUN (cloud). And other players around the world join to these hosted matches? Dedicated servers would simply be "non-player" master clients that hosts the games and let other players join to games. And also does server stuff by itself.So, I would create a standalone "server-only" Unity project file, that can manage servers, manage databases, create and sustain persistent worlds. All the features that won't be in user clients, can be in the server(host/master) client's project. And I can manage all these in the dedicated server inself.So to clarify: A "special" unity project that runs the game simulation, manage world, manage database, manage players, manage everything and run everything, will be the master client. Will host the game. And "client" unity projects will join to this game, and will "send" inputs for authoritative architecture. Server will "accept" these inputs, simulate it and send it back to clients.To more clarify: Everything that Photon Server should be handling will be handled by PUN and Cloud relay servers, RPC's and Serialize funtions. So I wont hustle my workload with the server programming. Win-Win. Right?I know, It is probably not the best solution out there. I haven't found any single document/topic about it. So It may be a really stupid idea to begin with. But I wonder. If I start with this type of architecture, when I get pass the prototype phase, would it be easy to implement Photon Server to server side? Would it be easy and work efficient to follow this approach? Or should I stop whatever I am doing, and start learning Photon server?|,<networking><unity3d><server><multiplayer><photon>

Angular 1+2 Hybrid app - Switching between ng1 and ng2 components using links causes blank page,I have a big existing angularjs+ngroute app to a ng1+ng2 hybrid app. The main ng2 app module template looks like thisThe div attribute app-header is an existing ng1 directive type 'A' which expands to a nav bar with the anchor links same as shown aboveWhen I click on index.html -> /stocks link the ng2 component shows up after When I click on index.html -> /example link the ng1 component does not show up in the ng-view.Similarly when I click on the header nav bar linksclick /stocks -> the does not work and it shows an empty space asclick /example -> It shows the ng1 example componentThe idea is to route to the appropriate ng1 and ng2 components from links in the app and make them appear in the outlet or the ng-view.

Trigger to find changed columns in table A and then use changed column names as data on INSERT to table B,|I have a table that inserts the status of a sensor every second. It does this by inserting a 0 or 1 into every column in the table. It will do an insert every second regardless. There are currently just 10 or so columns but this will grow to 100 or so in the near future. The table details are below. I know this is a horrible way to store this data but I cannot control how this data is inserted.I want to use an after insert trigger to see what columns have changed from a 0 to a 1 and insert a record into a new table, details below, with the old tables column name that changed in a field called MACHINE and the current timestamp in a column called START. I also want the trigger to watch for columns that have changed from a 1 to a 0 and do an update on the new table by changing the column called STOP to the current timestamp. This way I wind up with a new table that has the start and stop times the sensors were on and I can then delete records over a day old off the old table daily to keep it small.Doing a regular trigger with an insert or delete I have done but looping through columns and then using the actual column name as data for a row in the new table sounds daunting.

Circular references in Java and garbage collection,|Let's say I have the following classes as described below:If we look at a graph of the references, A references B (and B references A), B references C (and C references B). Now, if we were to call B's method removeReferenceToC(), then B's reference to the object C would be eliminated, but C would still reference B. At this point would C be eligible for garbage collection? The reason I'm not sure is that because of the direction of the references C can no longer be reached from B which makes me think that C is eligible for garbage collection, however the fact that C still references B is throwing me off. So if B nulls out its reference to C, will C be eligible for garbage collection?Edit:This question is being marked as a duplicate. I think the main difference between my question and the previously answered questions can be summed up by this: Previous questions: A -> B &lt;=> C then the ref from A to B gets removed leaving A B &lt;=> CMy question:A &lt;=> B &lt;=> C then the ref from B to C gets removed leaving A &lt;=> B &lt;- C|,<java><garbage-collection>

Properly de-marshall Angular FormGroup POST with linked objects,|TL;DR;In an Angular 2.x + Spring Data REST + Spring Boot 1.4 application, how do you define JSON object references which Spring can de-marshall into the domain model?DetailsFor example, if a recipe book contains labels and recipes created at the same time and each recipe has a reference to one or more labels, the representation might look like:where the array of labelRef using the array index in labels as client-side label identifiers (requiring array order to be guaranteed...).

JavaScript Sorting Runtime of Object acting as Array and Dictionary,|EDIT: It looks like what I've written below is a form of Pigeonhole Sort.I've been looking into how JavaScript Arrays are really special Objects and additionally have in-order iterators (since they are collections).Because of that, this code is possible:But since sorting algorithms have a fastest runtime of O(n log(n)), the conversion between JavaScript's object dictionary mode and array mode must slow it down. I tested it, and it does slow down as expected (although it is faster than the native .sort()), but it only covers sorting by toString() so obviously I'd go with the native version.So I have the following questions:Where specifically in the above code does it devolve into an O(n log(n)) algorithm?Can you link me the source code for this? In V8 for example.I'm assuming it would be a lazy iterator creation or access during the for...of phase, but I would love to see the code and why it is. |,<javascript><algorithm><sorting><v8>

Finding the last element of a multidimensional array that meets a condition through recursion,|I know there are not so many real-life examples of recursion. I think I found one today and I want to share it Q&amp;A style because I think it's fascinating.I'm using the Phaser engine for a game of mine. Upon a user click, I need to find the game element on which the user clicked. This becomes complicated once there are multiple elements one on top of another. Then, I would need to check their rendering order and pick the element with the highest one.In Phaser, the root of all display objects is the "world". All existing elements are either direct children of the world or children of children. It's a branching structure with the game world on top. The children are ordered by their rendering order, meaning that the last one is on top.Here's an example of this, having each display object represented by a number:There are three levels in this array with two main "groups". In game terms, the second group is added after the first, therefore it's rendered on top. Inside the first group, the last element is rendered on top, which is a group. Inside that group, the last element is rendered on top again and so on. Out of all these elements, the one rendered on the very top is 7 since it's the last.Let's say I click my mouse and it happens to be on top of all elements represented by a greater number than 10 (18, 14 and 16). The one I need is 16 since it's the furthest down.How do I get it?|,<javascript><arrays><recursion><order><rendering>

Periodically polling in Rx way,|I want to poll for some boolean variable till it gets false. I'd like to compose an Observable that emits single value and completes, only when the particular variable gets false.Here is what I've come with:Is the above a proper (read: most elegant &amp; concise) way to do it? Especially I'm wondering about the source Observable here, the one that emits in every 250ms, will it be unsubscribed and cleaned up (underlying timer destroyed in memory == OS resources freed) when takeWhile() operator emits completion event? Shortly, it is safe to use the above Observable as is, without leaking any resources (because of "forgotten" timer)? Most probably no, but I'd like to be 100% sure.P.S.: I'm writing this in RxJS but other platforms will probably have similar answer, so I'm not limiting the tags to RxJS.P.P.S.: Obviously, I'm talking about the scenario when I can't convert target variable into Observable, that's the whole point.

Old Elasticsearch shards are not deleted after relocation,|Our Elasticsearch cluster has two data directories. We recently restarted all the nodes in the cluster. After the successful restart process, we observed increased disk space usage on few nodes. When we examined the folders inside the data directory, we found that there are orphaned shards.For example, an orphaned shard "15" exists at location data_dir0/cluster_name/nodes/0/indices/index_name/15, while one of the replicas of the same shard "15" exists on the same node inside other data directory, here at data_dir1/cluster_name/nodes/0/indices/index_name/15. This shard "15" from data_dir1 is also included in cluster metadata and thus, we assume that shard "15" from data_dir0 is an orphaned shard and has to be deleted by Elasticsearch. But Elasticsearch hasn't deleted the orphaned shard yet, even after 6 days since last restart.We found this topic https://discuss.elastic.co/t/old-shards-on-re-joining-nodes-useful/182661 relating to our issue but it did not help us as in ES did not take care of that orphaned shard. We also raised the question on Elastic forum but we are not getting quick replies. So, I am asking it here as stack overflow has larger community.|,<elasticsearch>

How to dequeue subtitle UITableViewCell in code properly?,|I'm trying to create a UITableView with regular, non-custom .subtitle cells in pure code. However, the following code never gives me a cell with a proper detailTextLabel, instead opting for a .default cell.This is apparantly because dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier:) doesn't actually return nil, even if no cell is currently available. Instead, it always returns a .default if no cells have been created.The other option, dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier:for:) also always succeeds, so that wouldn't work either.So far, it looks impossible to create a non-.default style cell in pure code, without Interface Builder to define the style of a prototype cell.

Using for*/first correctly with annotations in Typed Racket,|I'm trying to understand how to use a for*/first loop in Typed Racket. Because everytime I try to execute my code I get a exception, that I need to add more annotations.I have the following for*/first loop:If I understand the official typed racket reference right, the type-annotations in a for*/first-loop are completely optional, but the values used in the loop must all be from the same type.I checked now the seq-expr in-range for it's type and it's an Sequence of Integers (Sequenceof Integer) and the current-pos is annotated as an Integer, so every value is de-facto an Integer. In the reference there is also mentioned the #:when must be the last for-clause (exactly like in my piece of code).Nevertheless every time I execute the code I get the error message: Type Checker: Error in macro expansion -- insufficient type information to typecheck. please add more type annotations in: (for*/first ((current-pos : Integer (in-range start-pos -1 -1)) #:when (char=? (string-ref input-string current-pos) character)) current-pos)So my question: How to write a for*/first loop in typed racket with correct annotations?There is also a similar looking question on stackoverflow, but the solution was only up-to-date before they added the possiblity to use the overloaded for*/first instead of the for*/first: function. But it was for me not possible to comment these question because of the "you-need-a-reputation-of-50-to-comment-policy".I have experimented a little bit in the REPL, the problem must be lying in the return value of the for*/first-loop.

Importing a file using Workbench returns 0 files when using column matching,|I am completely new to SQL.

How can I get rid of the duplication in this code?,|As part of a Proof of Concept, I'm trying to trying to build code that I can use to build GLSL scripts.

Here's what it looks like:So far, I've had no problems with the functionality of the code, but that duplication of the code where I define the types as an enum, and then write them again as a string literal is definitely troubling to me.

Facebook Messenger (Python) two different results same user,|Currently I am building a Facebook Messenger bot using this library PyMessenger and I am encountering a strange behavior.

For example, after writing one message, the output should be 1, and after writing the second message the output should be 2. Now, sometimes after I write a third message the output is 1, instead of 3.

Diagnosing OutOfMemory issues with Image Processing API in ASP.NET,|Running OutOfMemory in my relatively simple web API which is deployed to an Azure server.

How to improve performance by saving results of queries in tables,I'm working with a very large database and we want to display it's data using an online data visualization software. My problem is that the DB is so big I can't get a specific query to run in less than 30 seconds. This makes the experience of visualizing the data very poor and so I need to find a way to execute my queries faster.I've been evaluating running a maintenance plan that runs a procedure that selects this query into a table every 30 minutes or so.

Vagrant filesystem issues with npm,|I've been encountering a frequent error with Vagrant machines and npm, where the filesystem suddenly becomes read-only.

Sometimes an archive unpacking error occurs, but other times, npm fails with ENOENT errors. Upon logging in with vagrant ssh to finish the job, read-only filesystem errors appear. Despite this, there is plenty of space on the system (say, 7 out of 8GB remaining).Read-only filesystem errors also appear when the webpack server is running under the same circumstances.There are questions and tickets floating around that quote similar errors, but I haven't seen any exploration into what the underlying mechanism is.

Azure ConnectionString using totally wrong login credentials,|I have created an ASP.NET MVC website which accesses a database, both of which are hosted in azure.

Instead it is the master user that I have to access the db server and other areas of my azure resources.Here is the section from the web.config on my PC that was used to publish to azure:The Error message said I added some debug code to get the connection strings that were available and being used on the server and tried again.

|GSAP slider, destroy timeline on resize and reinitialize|,|I'm trying to get a full page clip style slider set up to handle resize, but I seem to be going in circles at this point despite trying a bunch of suggestions on this topic from the forum. I've already accomplished the basic effect - screen split in half vertically, each side has a timeline that is wiping towards the center revealing the slide below, which is simultaneously sliding towards center. Right side is on a slight delay intentionally. If you load the codepen and don't resize, you'll see what I mean.Window resizing is throwing me a curveball, though. I've set up debounced functions to kill the 2 current timelines and then rebuild them again with new resized viewport dimensions. It's getting the new window dimensions and setting up a new timeline with these specs succesfully, but resizing several times reveals that it must not be killing the old timelines and is just creating multiple copies at each viewport size.I'd like to be able to save the progress of the current timeline before destroying it and then initialize the new, resized timeline to this progress point so that to the user it just looks like one animation that pauses slightly on resize. Would also be great if, once the animation completes, window resize will not be able to initialize another timeline, so it can rest on the final slide. But, for now, just figuring out how to solve the current duplicate timelines issue would be awesome!These are functions I'm using on resize, but kill doesn't seem to do anything.|,<greensock><gsap><timelinelite>

Excel & MySQL -- Run-time error '13': Type mismatch,|First post, here goes. I am trying to make a dynamic query in Excel that retrieves data from a table in MySQL that has approximately 3M records. There are three variables I use to narrow down the results. Each of the variables is a list for the IN statement in SQL. I control which and how many items appear in the list in the spreadsheet. The variables/lists are as such:X = "AA", "BB", "CC"... Y = "DDDDD", "EEEEE", "FFFFF"... Z = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...The code works fine if there are only 1-2 items in each list or if one list is long and the others are just one item or so. The problem happens if all of the lists are long: "Run-time error '13': Type mismatch".When the query is successful, there's a pop-up that asks me to enter my password for the database.

DynamoDB queries return no items within Lambda function,|Basically, I have a DynamoDB connection within a Lambda function. Will post code below. This DynamoDB connection seems to be behaving properly - it's able to call the listTable and describeTable functions successfully, which means it's got the right configuration - but querying it returns nothing, even on queries I know are correct and have tested on the Dynamo console.UPDATE: Was able to successfully query with a string on a separate index, but still unable to query based on a binary...Here's a part of the Lambda function:I've tried using KeyConditions instead of KeyConditionExpression, to no avail. Value refers to a base64 identifier string that's passed along from an earlier Lambda function - I've tried hard-coding the correct value, doesn't help. The describeTable function is only there to detail that DynamoDB is connecting properly, and in the correct region.TL;DR: The data.Items value in the above code snippet is always an empty array, even when doing a query I know should return something.

How to unsubscribe and resubscribe after timespan?,|I need to unsubscribe and then resubscribe or somehow pause and ignore all emitted values of an Observable.In my component I subscribe to my Observable:In the service, I check for the existenece of the Object and if not, push a task to a queue where a server picks up the task and gets the information:The problem is, the server then pushes the list to the db and the client gets the list for every entry.

I can Ctrl-Shift-G on the include tbb and it navigates to the tbb.h file. I've restarted the machine.

Can someone help me modify this Excel VBA code?,|I have an excel macro spreadsheet that I'm trying to edit. This is a cleaner that cleans fields in certain columns used to process data.

I'm trying to get edit the cleaning macro. There is a clean all button which Will take Columns A-AP and create a new column next to it with the cleaned values. Each column also has individual button cleaners.Column B contains a sku number column (I.G 40118) and the clean button will add the manufacturer code to it (i.g. happ). Thus after pressing Clean, a column will be inserted in between B and C. In this new column will be the value happ40118. Column K is labeled Image name. So the value in for say K2 could be "hungryhippos-box.jpg" Currently the clean button for Column K just copies the value an pastes it in a cell from the new inserted column. I want the button to actually instead of copying the value take the values from the cells in the Cleaned_Sku Column (the newly created column C) and then tack on the extension from the value of Column K (.jpg) and concatenate them together in the newly created Column L. So the value will look like happ40118.jpg. Here is what what the code looks like below. Thanks|,<excel-vba>

Is it bad practice to call an optional function inside didSet of a variable?,|I have been looking for an easy way to automatically update UI when a variable is updated. Regular KVO is so much messy code, so I've been looking at RxSwift, ReactiveCocoa etc., but found these to be hard to grasp, and a lot of new objects and just too much stuff I don't need.I have been playing around with a variable's didSet, together with an emtpy optional function in my object. Hopefully it's easier to show than to explain:A custom object (a viewModel)And a custom UIView:Let's say this custom view AwesomeView exists in a UIViewController as an outlet.I create an instance of AwesomeViewModel, and then call self.awesomeView.bindViewModel(awesomeViewModel).When I later, in my UIViewController (or anywhere else, for that matter, it can be passed around) do something like awesomeViewModel.awesomeText = "Hello World", then the viewModel's variable's didSet will trigger the optional function updateBlock. Since this function has been set by the custom view AwesomeView, it will automatically update the text in the label in that view.I thought this was pretty cool, and easy to understand, but are there any side effects of this, or something I'm not seeing? Is it bad practice? It seems so much easier than using the standard KVO with all the functions and observing etc..I was thinking of using this for UITableViewCell's, where the bindViewModel() would be called in cellForRowAtIndexPath. I don't think there are any retain cycles or anything, but I'm not that good at spotting them..I was hoping to get some pros and cons about this method before I apply it to my app - only to find out it's the stupidest idea in the world.

KafkaStreams - InconsistentGroupProtocolException,|I have a Kafka Streams app that connects to our Kafka cluster using the Kafka Streams DSL, like so:KStreamBuilder builder = new KStreamBuilder();KStream&lt;String, byte[]&gt; stream = builder.stream(myTopic);// do workkStreams = new KafkaStreams(builder, config);kStreams.start();And another part of my code base that establishes a connection to our cluster using the consumer client directly.KafkaConsumer&lt;String, String&gt; consumer = new KafkaConsumer&lt;&gt;(config, keyDeserializer, valueDeserializer);consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList(sourceTopic));consumer.poll(500L);// etcconsumer.close();The reason I am doing this is to gather meta data about the consumer group before conditionally kicking off other parts of the app (which includes the Kafka Streams topology). There are probably other ways to do this (e.g. through various hooks or what not), but I am more curious about why the intermixing of these methods will sometimes (intermittently) lead to a InconsistentGroupProtocolException being thrown. Could someone please shed some light on why this is being thrown? I'm having a difficult time determining what exactly is going on from the source code itself, but I guess the underlying consumers that are constructed by Kafka Streams are specifying a different partitioning protocol than the KafkaConsumer client.

Am I missing something in Core Text that will let me see which line a certain point is in and how tall a line really is including paragraph styles?,|So I am trying to write a custom NSView with text in it but not using NSTextView (since it will be more than just text). I can use Core Text to draw text, but now I also need to be able to do hit-testing and drawing of the caret and selection rects.The naive way of drawing carets and selections, as shown by various Apple samples, is to get the typographic bounds of the various CTLines encompassing the desired string range (using CTLineGetBoundsWithOptions(0) instead of CTLineGetTypographicBounds() due to various errors in the latter) and filling the resultant rects. Unfortunately, as soon as there is a paragraph style of any sort (be it paragraph spacing, line spacing, or line height) this stops working because paragraph styles are not included in the typographic bounds. If you select text that spans multiple lines, you'll see that somewhat iconic white gap between the lines! And this still does not answer the question of how to know what line to use if I am clicking on the whitespace between lines.After fighting over typographic bounds rects overlapping or having gaps between them due to how Core Text does snapping metrics points to integers by default, I noticed that if I call CTFrameGetLineOrigins() I can determine the height of line i + 1 by computing origins[i].y - origins[i + 1].y; the height of line 0 is the height of the frame minus the height of the combined other lines. The use of i + 1 here is important; it deals with odd scenarios caused by fonts that have the space height different from other character heights.However, with this technique, I cannot differentiate between spacing above a line and spacing below a line, whether that space is paragraph or line space. All spacing is treated as being above the line, and if multiple spacing modes are used, they just combine. I have a small program that you can use to experiment with this for yourself; click the "Baseline Diffs" checkbox to shade in line heights.So the question is: what am I missing that I can't figure out how tall a line really is and where its baseline is relative to its height, regardless of the paragraph style? Or do I need to reimplement the internal logic of Core Text myself if I want to do this? I do have a lot of the pieces together, but a lot of it is highly conditional...And what happens on the last paragraph? Should I simulate the trailing space there?The solution needs to run on OS X 10.8 or newer.Thanks.|,<osx><cocoa><core-text>

How to start work in a non-main-thread QObject,|Based on the Qt docs and other examples on the web, I would have thought that the following program, which uses QThread.started signal, would start workers in non-main threads. But this is not the case, instead each work slot is called from main thread: If I use a custom signal instead, it works fine. To see this, comment out the "method 2" line and uncomment the "method 1" line and repeat the run. It would certainly be nicer to start the workers without having to create a custom signal, is there a way to do this (while sticking to the design of calling moveToThread on the workers)? Note: The docs for QThread.started signal don't help much:  This signal is emitted from the associated thread when it starts executingTo me this implies that started would be emitted in the non-main thread, such that the work slot it is connected to would get called in the non-main thread, but this is clearly not the case. Even if my interpretation is incorrect and the signal is in-fact emitted in the main thread, the connection type is for both methods the default Qt.AutoConnection, to a slot on a QObject moved to another thread, so the started signal should be transmitted asynchronously (i.e. through each checker's QThread event loop), again clearly not the case. |,<python><pyqt><pyqt5><signals-slots><qthread>
URLSession on Linux giving different result than on iOS,|I've got a simple class making a HTTP POST request (to a Neo4j server, but that shouldn't matter) using URLSession, and an integration test that tests that it succeeds.Through Xcode, via the iOS simulator, I can run this test a million times - it succeeds every time.However, when I run swift test on Ubuntu Linux (I use the docker image provided by IBM) then I very often will get a test failure saying I got a 401 response.Replicating that via cURL in the container does not fail at all, so I do not believe this to be a problem with my container.I have added a packet dump (that I inspect via Charles Proxy) where our of 15 test runs, 7 test runs (and thus 7 requests) fail. All of the failed requests complain that no authentication header was supplied. And from the dump, that is correct, the dump does not contain the authentication header for those requests that fail.

Boost C++ - Ordering size not the same as graph size,|As a follow up to my question Boost graph segmentation fault and to the older question Planar graph drawing C++, I have a planar graph in Boost that is not maximal planar but it has at least three edges. I call make_connected, make_biconnected_planar and make_maximal_planar on it so that it should now be maximal planar.When I call planar_canonical_ordering on it, the ordering should be the same size as the original graph, but it is not for certain graphs, which causes a segmentation fault in chrobak_payne_straight_line_drawing because the ordering is of size &lt; 3.What I don't understand is why the planar canonical ordering is not the same size as the graph itself. Certainly, there are specific edges that could be added to the graph to increase its ordering size, as noted in the answer to the first question, but that is not a general case. If the graph is maximal planar, why is its ordering (ordering.size()) not the same size as the graph (num_vertices(g)) itself?|,<c++><boost><graph>

Dividing up a table of two-way relationships into distinct groups,|I'm working on an application where users can tag "components" as part of the workflow. In many cases, they end up with several tags that are synonyms of each other. They would like these to be grouped together so that when one tag is added to a component, the rest of the tags in the group can be added as well.I decided to break up tag groups into two-way relationships between each pair of tags in the group. So if a group has tags 1 and 2, there's a record that looks like this:Basically, a group is represented as a Cartesian product of each tag in it. Extend that to 3 tags:Our relationships look like this:I have a couple methods to group them together, but they're less than stellar. First, I wrote a view that lists each tag along with the list of tags in its group:The problem with this is that each group appears in the results as many times as there are tags in it, which I wasn't able to think of a way to work around in a single query. So it gives me back:Then in my back-end, I discard all groups that contain a key that occurs in another group. Tags aren't being added to multiple groups, so that works, but I don't like how much extraneous data I'm pulling down.The second solution I came up with was this LINQ query. The key used to group the tags is a listing of the group itself. This is probably much worse than I originally thought.I really hate grouping by the result of calling string.Join, but when I tried just grouping by the list of keys, it didn't group properly, putting each tag in a group by itself. Also, the SQL it generated is monstrous. I'm not going to paste it here, but LINQPad shows that it generates about 12,000 lines of individual SELECT statements on my test database (we have 1562 tags and 67 records in RelatedTags).These solutions work, but they're pretty naive and inefficient.

Managing Wordpress Modular Content Created With Template Parts,|I'm creating a website for a client using wordpress as the cms and writing a custom theme.As the client's organisation is relatively new and they don't know exactly what type of content they will need, I have to make content block templates for each possible scenario.I've only been using wordpress for 9 months but from my research it looks like the best way to make these 'building blocks' is through template parts. As an example there will be three blocks on one page:a grid of the 5 latest blog posts a slider galleryan about descriptionMaking these with template parts seems possible but I would like my client to be able to add a video block when they are readyrearrange the blocks when they decide it's in the wrong orderdelete/hide blocks they don't need...all from the admin panel.So my questions are:Is template parts the right tree up which to bark to create these content blocks?Do I need to use a plugin to be able to manage the content blocks from the admin panel?Is there a plugin that will allow me to add any of the template parts I've created, and rearrange and delete them when necessary?Thanks for your help and wisdomHP|,<php><wordpress><custom-wordpress-pages>
Encryption program with python using a specific function,|I'm trying to write a python program that is going to encrypt the user's input message by using an equation that is also given by the user.

Filter Pixel Using ColorMap on Different ImageLayer Attribute,|In the ArcGIS Javascript API, according to the documentation, a ImageLayer's pixels can be filtered using the RasterFunction class.

The number of data points in the first set is 25186.

Using ES6 properly with 'this' keyword,|I am porting an ES5 Angular application to ES6 + Babel + Browserify and I am trying to create a specific class that is used for transforming data.

I understand that this is based off the context of the calling method which in this case is inside the processResponse method, however, I have not dealt with ES6 very much so have not ran into this issue before.I can fix this real quick by just treating ExchangeMailboxesResponse as a closure and place the applyUI method inside of that method so it creates a closure around the applyUI method and therefore has access to it when its called.

So for example the user has a user interface form that has a list of values drop down element. THey click the value and the ID gets stored to the database.Later on recall the user wants to pull the data back up for review... in mvc it seems you are stuck with displaying the ID field in the textbox.but in most other systems you can make a datatable and return the text value of the field back to the form...

|Can a grouping Key for <IGrouping<string, ItemsCollection>> be modified such that it is appended with a group count info for binding?|,|The following query returns Type &lt;IGrouping&lt;string, ItemsCollection&gt;&gt; which can be bound to a GridView. Used with CollectionViewSource, the Key (as a group name) is used to show a group header/title, say by binding to a TextBlock in GroupStyle.HeaderTemplate for GridView.All is working fine as expected and no problem so far.My next attempt (where I find difficulty) is for the Key, which outputs a group name to also provide the group item count, such that it would be modified, for example, as "Group Name [count]" where count can be readily obtained as groups.Count() in the query. Suppose ItemsObjCollection represents Fruits, then the header output is desired to be like Apples [10], Bananas [7], Oranges [12], and so on.Can a grouping Key, for the purpose of output display (via binding), be modified such that it is appended with a group count info as described? Basically, I would like Key = $"{groups.Key} [{groups.Count()}]" but don't know how within the query. Tried along the line of:select new { Key = $"{groups.Key} [{groups.Count()}]", Items = groups };but my modified Key doesn't show up in the binding, so didn't get far. I also find that is not straight-forward to create an instance of IGrouping (because it's an interface) and hoping there is a clever way to do it within a query statement above, and someone must have done this already.|,<c#><linq><winrt-xaml><uwp-xaml>

I don't quite get it, do people mean page_load event is handled before button click event? if yes then I understand, so is it just something like when we click a submit button, we actually fire 2 events, one for button click event, and one for page load event and page load event is handled first?Can anyone put these stages in a simple way to explain how each stage steps in? like when a user clicks a button, what's happening behind the scene|,<asp.net>

Git - Change List (svn) Equivalent,|We used svn for years, and have recently switched over to Git. We used to use change lists in svn for a specific purpose. They are similar to global ignores but not exactly the same. A global ignore tells svn not to add files that fit the pattern, but if a file is already added to version control, the ignore won't do anything. This is the same thing in Git. Git ignore files tell Git to ignore files that match a given pattern, but only if they have not yet been added to version control. Change lists in svn allowed us to specify files that had already been added in to version control. Once the files had been added to the change list, svn would ignore these files on commit. The basic advantage of this is that you can freely edit certain files without the fear of accidentally commiting a change that you don't want to go in to the main code base. A good example scenario is when you want to work with a specific customer's configuration and add customer specific references to your project files that should not exist in the core code base.Git has the concept of stashes which is different again. We can store deltas in a stash in a local repo. These can be freely applied, pushed, or popped which solves one part of the problem. However, when we do a commit (through some gui tool - tortoise git, gitkraken, VS), these files will still show up in the list of files that Git wants to commit. I don't want them to show up because I will more than likely make a mistake and commit them accidentally.Is there some way to achieve change list like functionality in Git?Note: I really don't want to have to do this through the command line. I use a combination of Visual Studio, Git Kraken, and Tortoise Git. I like the Gui system. I don't want to have to run a command at the command prompt which will automatically commit my changes while avoiding the files I specify.|,<git><svn><version-control><changelist>
Django csrf fails after logout login new user,|Even if I understand the problem, I'm not sure how to solve this. I have a django powered api that has an endpoint that lets the user change the email.

jQuery DataTables performance with individual column select filters and large number of rows,|I currently have a client-sourced table with individual column select drop-downs that work amazing. I have about 1000 rows and the performance is great. Amazing jQuery plug-in. Problem: my client just told me that this could grow to upwards of 40000 in a month. My client also told me that they really like the individual select filters in the footers and I can't remove them. Hence, I am worried about performance. See here if you don't know what I'm talking about when I say individual select filters:https://datatables.net/examples/api/multi_filter_select.htmlI was poking around and I saw the example here using client side and deferred rendering:https://datatables.net/extensions/scroller/examples/initialisation/large_js_source.htmlBut the issue is I don't believe I can use deferred rendering since the client wants the individual column select filters. I have to load up all the data for the select filters to even work...Does anyone have any idea how I can accomplish this behavior of individual column filtering with good speed at high number of rows or suggest a reasonable alternative?

I am using Web API (ASP.NET Core 1.0) and I will implement a Generic Repository using Entity Framework.

In this action I am working with 4 different entities and 4 repositories.Because it is REST the url's should be like (this are examples):GET/POST api/Planet - get all planets / create new planetGET api/Planet/{planetId}/Territory - get all territories from planet idGET api/Territory/{territoryId}/Mine - get all mines from territory idGET api/Territory/{territoryId}/Building - get all buildings from territory idGET api/Territory/{territoryId}/Resource - get all resources from territory idSo, has you can see, my TerritoryController has dependencies from 3 different services (MineService, BuildingService, ResourceService) and in the future could have more.My Territory model will have a lot of information, it can have more child entities than now, so this means that my controller will have a lot of dependencies and I want to abstract all of this!

What is the best way to position a 'frame' around something in html?,|I do not mean an html &lt;frame>. I mean something like the frame that goes around this text box that I am typing into on here, with a border and a button bar with some icons in it.I'd like some editable content that can exist in 2 modes. The first is view mode, where you see the content. The second is editing mode, where a frame appears around it with any controls needed to assist with the editing.I'd like the frame to not interrupt the normal page flow of the content. So if there was something very close above the content, then the tool bar would sit on top of it in the z-plane. The frame should appear to sit on top of the page, not within it.I thought about getting the absolute screen coordinates of the thing being wrapped and using 'fixed' positioning to get the frame in the right place.But I am wondering if 'absolute' positioning might work? Except in this case the absolutely positioned frame would be the parent of the thing it wraps, and 'absolute' positions a child relative to a parent, not a parent relative to a child. Or could a child that is positioned with absolute actually have a larger size than the child, and therefore wrap it like I describe?|,<html><css><position>

No Audio Output on Kivy Applications Running on a Rasperry Pi Jesse,|Esteemed Colleagues -- I hope you're doing well. I'm hoping you can help me figure out a weird audio issue running Kivy on Raspberry Pi. In a nutshell, I can't get Kivy to produce any audio running on Raspberry Pi. I'm not sure on other hardware as I'm only developing on RPi. My code is below. This is just a simple soundboard app. Press a button and it plays a file. It should work in theory, but it doesn't. I have read every single relevant StackOverflow and Reddit post. I've tried dozens of variations of my code. No matter what I do Kivy is still as silent as mouse. Here is what I'm running:Raspberry Pi 3 Model BRasbian -- Linux raspberrypi 4.4.38-v7+ #938 SMP Thu Dec 15 15:22:21 GMT 2016 armv7l GNU/LinuxKivy -- 1.9.2-dev0What I've tried: USB Audio &amp; System Audio -- I tried using the system audio (headphone) jack as well as a USB sound card. Specifically, I'm using Plugable USB Headphone Adapter. Yes, my speakers are plugged in to the right ports. I've updated my configuration files to default to the USB adapter as I was getting too much interference from the system board output. Formats -- I've tried both MP3, WAV, OGG format. No dice. Playing From Terminal -- I can get the system to produce audio using other methods. I can get Rasbian to play audio as well as on the terminal using mpg321. This command "mpg321 "/home/pi/burnedpi/assets/audio/scotch.mp3" will successfully decode and play the MP3 file. It will output sound just fine via USB. I've tested my speakers in the terminal with "speaker-test -c2 -t wav" command and they work. I've adjusted and confirmed my audio internal audio mixer settings in alsmixer. The sound card has the volume properly turned up. Other Commands and Programs Work -- I'm pretty sure that this issue is just related to Kivy on Pi. Other applications are able to produce sound just fine. Example Kivy Audio Applications Don't Work -- The official Kivy audio examples that get installed by default do not produce any audio.Essentially, I'm just trying to get Kivy to output sound. I've got a real simple script that outputs an audio file when a mouse is clicked. I'm really stuck and don't know what to do next. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers. Steve.

Keep-together on topic level,|I am customizing the pdf2 plugin for dita-ot 2.4. My formatter is FOP.I want to make my plugin prefer page breaks between topics. Hence, I tried adding the following attributes in the "topic" attribute set;"keep-together.within-page" with a value (20)"keep-with-previous.within page" set to auto (to override any other settings)When I look at topic.fo it seems that it is only applied to "empty" topicrefs (headings without body text) without href attribute, but that may contain other topicrefs.Example:Section 1Some body text...Section 2Section 2.1Some more body text...In this example, the wanted attributes are only found on the first fo:block of Section 2.I have a number of "keep-with-previous.within page" with values lower than 20 on elements such as tables, figures, body text of different levels.I just want to ask if there is a simple solution to my struggles. it would be nice to set these attributes on topic level as a start and not only try to "glue" the different parts together.Best Regards,Fredrik|,<xsl-fo><dita-ot>

Correct handling of parallel insertion PHP/MySQL,|I have a PHP app which receives information from an external source, and saves data to MySQL.The algorithm is very simple. The data being sent is a string, and it works this way:Receive the data in $data. Ex: $data = "info"Checks in database if "info" exists. Ex: select count(*) from table where data="info"If "info" exists, then exitElse insert "info" in database and exit.When there are several parallel requests to the page, there are some duplicates. The data can be sent twice of more times, but we need to save it just once.The reason is that there's a time lapse between the steps 2 and 3, where the data is still not inserted, so two instances can insert it at the same time.What's the correct way to handle this in PHP?

Google Maps: Detecting down and move events on google map,|In an attempt to be able to rotate the map in my app 360 degrees around the user with one finger (thing pokemon go style) I came up with the following solution. I laid a view over the entire fragment that contains the map, and added an onTouchListener to it, as the map cannot have an onTouchListener set to it. The code below rotates the map when the user drags one finger, and it is actually working quite well.The issue however is that while I can rotate the map, the markers become untouchable, because the view on top is consuming all of the touch events. So I added a case to return false if an MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN was detected. This also works, however, since the user will obviously always perform an ACTION_DOWN action before an ACTION_MOVE action, it means the map rotation code is never reached.I'm stuck in a situation where I can either rotate the map properly, while not being able to select the map markers, or being able to select the map markers, without being able to rotate the map.Does anybody have any suggestions on how I may get this working? It would be so much easier if the google map could just have an onTouchListener.|,<android><google-maps>

lambda function in mpl_connect multiplies input keystroke?,|Following this example I tried to use a lambda function to pass my controller of my Tkinter widget through mpl_connect, located at a different frame (as the controller contains some general variables).

Each key stroke calls the on_key_event instance only once.The new version, where I attempt to pass through the controller to on_key_event with the lambda function behaves quite differently. Each key stroke seems to call the on_key_event instance multiple times (seemingly a random number smaller than 10).Is this related to the lambda function behaving slightly different than I am expecting?

Losing data when gracefully disconnecting a socket,|I'm writing a multi-threaded network server in Python to receive data. I don't control the other end but it's very simple: it will push data when it connects, there is no communication from my end back to it higher than TCP itself.

Here's some simplified code:Then in the new thread:So when running is false it will break out and close the connection. The conn.shutdown(socket.SHUT_WR) call closes the socket for writing and sends a FIN to start disconnecting. Looking with wireshark I see the FIN packet is acknowledging the final data packet sent from the other side - no more data is sent after this and the connection closes. The problem is that the data in that last packet is never returned by recv(). That final call to recv() returns empty which indicates the connection is closed and there is no more data. If it were still waiting it would raise socket.timeout instead.I'm at a loss for how to access this last record that gets sent to me.

How to log ODataExceptions? ExceptionLogger isn't working,|I am attempting to log exceptions within an OData v4 service built on WebApi 2.2. I am using NLog for logging. I created a simple ExceptionLogger (NLogExceptionLogger) class for this purpose. NLogExceptionLogger does log unhandled exceptions just fine but it doesn't log all exceptions. If I manually throw an exception as a test it works just fine. (See Controller example)The specific ones that I am looking for are Microsoft.OData.ODataExceptions that are thrown when the ODataQuery is validated. The error information is returned in the response but is not logged by the NLogExceptionLogger. Basically for queries that try to $expand or $select fields that haven't been enabled, I want to see those exceptions in the log.My assumption is that ExceptionLogger only sees unhandled exceptions which is less helpful that I had hoped.

How to replace a function in a namespace?,|I am writing some unit tests for a module that uses a scheduler. I'm writing a fake of the scheduler so that I can examine what events have been scheduled, cancelled, etc.The code I'm testing calls the schedule function directly with the help of using namespace X calls, and the final call is scheduler::schedule(). So, I need to have my fake's function be the one called when that function call is made.I can't change the library, and I think what I need to do here is override the function in the namespace, but I'm not exactly sure how I should do this. To top it off, the scheduler is implemented elsewhere and is imported to this code project with using namespace calls, and the library implementation has several different using namespace X calls in it at each level of namespace nesting "for backwards compatibility."How should I go about doing this?Basically, we have this:And then in my local codebase:And now, the code I'm writing looks like:So, what I need is that call to scheduler::schedule() to be for my fake.

Using SharedElement Activity transitions with a custom View,|I am working on a proof-of-concept where I have a few custom views in a TableLayout. When one of the Views is clicked I want to animate the view expanding into a new Activity. The effect I want to achieve is similar to what is seen here.From my research, it seems the way to do this is with shared element Transitions. However, I can't get it to work correctly and I am wondering if it is because I am using my own custom View. Specifically, the fades are happening, but the scaling and translating motions are not. Check the GIF below to see where I am. In the example I click the upper left circle, which I want to transform to the full circle in the new activity. The issue can also be seen when the back button is pressed.I believe it is incorrect because the View must be drawn, but is there a way to customize my View further to make this work?

Saving status in broadcast receiver to be later used in the UI,I have a broadcast receiver that keeps track of some external events and acts upon them as required. And I also have a fragment in my application that shows a status summary of what the last event/status is/was. Now I am currently using a shared preference to save this status in the receiver and then a onSharedPreferenceChange Listener to update the fragment if it is currently being viewed. I am in a debate with myself if I should be doing it this way? Or register a broadcast receiver with the fragment when it starts instead of using a shared preference. But the problem I then have is that the fragment will be unable to get the current status when it opens and won't know what is happening until another event is broadcast. Is this an appropriate use of shared preferences? The status will change anywhere from once every few seconds to 30+ seconds. And one would use the broadcast receiver in the fragment if an update/status change was received every second or less? ,<android><android-fragments><android-broadcastreceiver><android-sharedpreferences>

Dynamically load different css files in angular2 application based on user's language,|I have an Angular2 application and it need to support multiple languages. Some of these languages may be RTL (i.e Persian) and some will be LTR (i.e. English). Apart from localizing strings, I need to style my components based on the direction of the language. Now using this helper, I can have two separate files (i.e. app-rtl.scss &amp; app-ltr.scss) which both import a single scss file (i.e. app.scss) which allows me to write my scss code in one place and automatically output two files; one for each direction.The problem is now I need to somehow reference the suitable css file based on the user's language. So if the user's language is English then I should have&lt;link href="app-ltr.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; in the header and if it's RTL, &lt;link href="app-rtl.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;. Furthermore I want to add bootstrap to my project and that also has two different output files for LTR and RTL.Is there any clean way to achieve this functionality?What I've tried:I've create two dummy component (one for LTR and one for RTL) without any template and then assign the respective scss file with styleUrls and set encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None so that it becomes a global style. Then I initialize both of them in my root component template with an *ngIf and check if the language is LTR or not.This would work on the first page load because only one component (let's say component LTR) is active, but as soon as you change the language (i.e the second component (RTL) becomes active and thus LTR is removed) then the styles associated with the LTR stays on the page and is not removed.

Whats the point of code folding if it always unfolds, or am I doing something wrong here?Additionally (separately), when i run head() on a dataframe, rather than printing out the first six rows of the dataframe in the console (which I prefer), instead it shows at the bottom of the editor the dataframe. Can I revert this behavior back?|,<r><rstudio>
SonarQube - unable to write message error,|We have just updated to TFS 2017 and I'm going through setting up SonarQube integration into pull requests for our builds. In the process I've come across an issue that I can't seem to figure out. We have three build servers each with two sets of build agents on them. Let's call them BA1 and BA2. Also, we are using the new SonarQube plugin for TFS not the deprecated one referenced here. BA2 works perfectly. Haven't had a single problem with generating both incremental and full analysis reports. However, any build that is using BA1 ultimately makes it about halfway through the End Analysis step before failure with a message similar to this:I'm pretty sure it's not a permissions problem because all builds run under the same user account. It doesn't matter which project or build server it runs on. All jobs that run with BA2 are successful. All jobs that run with BA1 fail with this error. I saw a similar question here but the solution to that problem will not work for me. I don't have an issue with another job being queued into the same workspace.Just trying to see if its possible anyone has run into this before. I've checked the build agent logs under the _diag directory but haven't been able to find anything useful. I've run out of ideas to check.

Bukkit: How to permentately store player and class information?,|Currently, I'm writing a RPG plugin. I've created a PlayerInfo class that stores the player's UUID, character class like knight and archer, and skills that modify a player's attributes, e.g. vitality would increase a players health, strength would increase a player's physical damage, and so on. Here's the class so far:I'd like to say as well that I'm primarily a Python and Javascript programmer. I picked up Java about 2 days ago, so I apologize if my code is unhygienic. I'm still trying to understand the languages and its practices. If you would like, I'd appreciate any advice on that as well. Though, feel free to just answer my base question, as I will be posting to Code Review, too, at some point in the future. Moving forward... While working on the basic framework of this plugin, I've realized that the information within the PlayerInfo class is most likely not saved when the server is stopped. I thought that possibly I could write the information, using FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream, to a file, and store that in a config folder, and later retrieve it with the Input versions of those modules. However, I ran into an issue when trying to dynamically pick up the path of the jar file, as my server told me that my Access was denied when trying to create the folder and file. My last issue comes when trying to use the loaded information. My plugin's commands start with /static. If I had a command named /static stats that displayed the users stats, would it be as simple as comparing the user's UUID to the one stored in the save file? For example:Or is there a different way to go about doing it?To condense my post down a bit:How can I store Player and class information effectively, and how can I later retrieve that data to use for information and see if the current player matches a saved object?

|How to achieve a snappy, cascading UX via AngularJS + ui-router|,|Using my beautiful graphic above I would like to explain a few things:header has some API data to retrieve about the user (e.g. GET /user/me)Authors has its own GET /authors it uses to populate that viewBooks and Movies are the same as Authors, they are just their own stateNow this is what I want:I want a cascading layout whereby the main layout of the page can be loaded first, then the "library" application can be loaded on top of it without any "lag" or blocking of the UX.However, with how ui-router seems to work today, if I have 1 resolve in this entire application and I place it in the "library" state, what happens is the "header" and "navbar" states are blocked until the resolve completes. What I would expect to happen is the parent states load first with their views, then the "library" state blocks on the resolve. That way you could see the navbar and header in the browser as soon as the page is loaded, but you would get a loading bar or spinner until the "library" resolve finished.Any easy way to achieve this functionality would be to not use resolves and instead just have all the API logic inside the controller, however this causes the scope of each of the 3 resources to be limited to their controller and that is it. Meaning, if you are in the Movies controller, you have no visibility into the Authors resources because Authors are scoped to only the "Authors" controller. This makes things like web sockets less efficient and even unusable.Am I doing something wrong here which is causing me to not get the desired functionality or is this not possible with this kind of architecture?|,<angularjs><angular-ui-router>

Calculating Entropy and Information Gain,|I was confused about calculating the entrophy and information gain to form a decision tree for the picture given below. All the examples i've seen up until this point had a result of either success or failure. This one doesn't have a result that I can interpret as true or false. How do I calculate the entrophy of let's say "Weather" here. And same thing for information gain, how do I calculate the information gain of "Weather"?The logic I followed was let's say for With FamilyP(Park) for with family(no) = 1/2P(TV) for with family(no) = 1/2P(Theatre) for with family(no) = 0P(Theatre) for with family(yes) = 1All else for with family(yes) = 0Therefore H(No) = -1/2*log(1/2) - 1/2*log(1/2) = 1.Therefore H(Yes) = -1*log(1) = 0.Total H(With Family) = 1+0 = 1.Edit: I noticed that i've been assuming total entrophy is always 1. Now I'm beginning to think this isn't the case. Correct me if I'm wrong but if there are more than 2 results(Decision) the total entrophy will surpass 1. In this case I calculated the total entrophy to be:P(park)*logP(park) + P(theatre)*logP(theatre) + P(TV)*logP(TV) = 1.575 approximately. I had been getting information gains that are less than 0, which doesn't make any sense. Now they're all greater than 0 but Gain for With Family is now greater than 1, which I think doesn't make any sense?|,<artificial-intelligence><entropy><information-gain>

Why is my Java app exceeding Heroku memory limit?,|I have a Java web app running on heroku which keeps generating "Memory quota exceeded" messages. The app itself is quite big and has a lot of libraries, but it is getting only very few requests (it is only used by a handful of users so if none of the users are online the system may not get a single request for hours) and thus performance is not a primary problem.Even though the is very little happening in my app the memory consumption is consistently high:Before deploying the app on heroku I deployed the app using docker containers and never worried much about memory setting leaving everything at the defaults. The whole container usually consumed about 300 MB.The first thing I tried was to reduce memory consumtion by using -Xmx256m -Xss512k however this did not seem to have any effect.The heroku manual suggests to log some data about garbage collection, so used the following flags to run my application: -Xmx256m -Xss512k -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC. This gives me e.g. the following output:Unfortunately I am no expert on reading those logs, but on a first naive look it looks like the app is actually not consuming an amount of memory that would be a problem (or am I horribly misreading the logs?).My Procfile reads:UpdateAs codefinger suggested I added the Heroku Java agent to my app. For some reason after adding the java-agent the problem did not occur anymore. But now I have bean able to capture the problem. In the following except the memory limit was exceeded only for a short moment:In the following case the limit was exceeded for a much longer time:For the later log here is the bigger picture:(memory consumption dropped because I restarted the server)At the time the memory limit is first exceeded a cron job (spring scheduled) imports CSV files. The CSV files are processed in batches of 10,000 lines, so there are never more than 10K rows referenced in memory. Nevertheless a lot of memory is of course consumed overall, as many batches are processed. Also I tried to trigger the imports manually to check whether I can reproduce the memory consumption peak, but I can't: This does not always happen.|,<java><memory><heroku>

Goal Seek-esque macro without formulas in the Excel sheet?,|I have a sheet that pulls columns of data from an external source, and a macro which then uses that data to calculate and populate other columns in the sheet.

If this were all Excel formulas then I could do a simple Goal Seek, but all of the calculations are carried out in vba. I am new to vba so I'm not sure if what I'm asking is even possible.

ASP.NET Core WebApp(.NET Core) missing DataAnnotations,|Following situation:I have a .sln with multiple projects (data-access, business-objects, business-logic, web-server). The Web-Project is an ASP.NET Core Web Application using .Net-Core 1.1 with the individual user account authorization (Identity) and the "WebApplication"-Template. The rest of the projects is using the .Net-Framework 4.6.2.Now I am about to remove the DBContext from the web-server and instead use the same as in the data-access-project. I set up my ApplicationDBContext accordingly and my User entity extends the IdentityUser. I also changed everything in the web-server-project to use the ApplicationDBContext (in my case called WTHListModell). I also has the references to the projects WTHList.GO (business-objects) and WTHList.DZ (data-access).Now here comes the problem: Doing this using the full .NET-Framework for the Web-Server (creating a ".NET-Core Web-Application (.Net-Framework)" ) is successful and works just fine. With .Net-Core 1.1 I am getting a FileNotFound-Exception regarding "System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations" whenever I try to either log-in or register a user.Now I have read, that DataAnnotations isn't compatible with .Net-Core and I also tried to add other NuGet-Packages and Assemblies to the Web-Project.I don't know what else I can do about that, because I am supposed to use the .NET-Core Framework 1.1 for the Web-Projekt and it keeps on giving me this particular error.Has anybody got a clue on how to solve this issue?

minimizing costs depending on group constellation,|I have a problem and I am not quite sure of the best way to approach it. So if you find the time to share some thoughts on this matter, I would appreciate it. :)The following example illustrates the structure of the problem I am confronted with. There are four types of actors (A,B,C and D) that are related to each other in a specific manner: each type of actor influences at least one other type of actor. The specific influence is depending on the specific combination of actors facing each other. That means if A meats B, A has a weighted influence on B of 1.2 (w1). But if A meats a group consisting of B and C, A influences B with a weight of 0.48 (1.2*0.4 -> w1*w2) and C with 0.12 (0.2*0.6). There are two groups influencing each other. Each of the two groups can consist of more than one type of actor and each type of actor can have a specific number of members. Group 1 could consist of 5 Bs and 10 Cs. In the given example the potential influence group 1 could possibly have on another group is 2.5 (5*0.5 -> members_B*w1) on C + 18 (10*1.8) on D. in this scenario group 2 has 10 members of type A, 5 Cs and 10 Ds. As the influence of group 1 is depending on the constellation of group 2, group 1's real influence equals 0 As, 2.5 Cs and 10 Ds. Group 2 has to pay contact costs (cost1) for each actor inluenced by group 1: 125 C (2.5*50 - influence_on_C*cost1) + 5000 D (10*500) = 5125. As both groups are influencing each other, group 1 has to pay contact costs as well: 1000 B + 60 C = 1060. Additionally each group has to pay some kind of maintenance costs (cost2) for its specific group constellation. Group 1 has to pay 25 B (5*5 -> members_B*cost2) + 500 C (10*50) = 525. group 2 has to pay 100 A (10*10) + 250 C (5*50) + 200 D (20*10) = 550.Long story short: I do know the specific constellation of group 1 and I am looking for an efficient method to calculate the optimal constellation of group 2. Optimal - in this context - means:min contact costs (cost1) for group 2max contact costs (cost1) for group 1min group costs (cost2) for group 2|,<r><minimization>

Overlapping memory addresses in x64 C function from PInvoke,|We have a PInvoke as follows:With the C declaration as follows: When running the .NET application as x86, it works fine.

Both State and InputData are void*, so they should be 8 bytes long whereas the rest should be 4 bytes.If I set a breakpoint in the function, the value is state is 2. Lets assume the memory address of state is determined to be 0x00000008.The memory address of inputData comes back as 0x0000000C, inputIndex as 0x00000010, and inputLength as 0x00000014.First problem, why is the memory address of inputData 4 bytes after state and inputIndex 4 bytes after inputData? Shouldn't state and inputData be 8 bytes each?Second problem, if I actually check the memory addresses of where the values should be, they're there, but where is 1? 1 is at 0x00000000.How does this even happen?

Multi-table Attribution Calculation,|I'm trying to generate an attribution model for our company's emails based off a few different related tables. I'm fairly new to DAX, so I've been fumbling around a bit (on this site mostly) searching for examples of how to achieve the result we're looking for.The attribution model we're looking at using is linear attribution because it works best with the way our industry operates.The logic behind this is as follows:If I were to plot a simple example, where the X axis is the individual mailings, the Y axis is the individual customers, and the values are the total customer conversion divided by the number of emails opened, it would look something like this (Apologies if it breaks on mobile. No table markup in SO):The data model that I have created is in an example file hosted here.I've tried creating a few measures and calculated columns to determine the total conversion value in the LineItems table which is properly filtering to only customers who have a direct conversion and have opened emails. The measure is returning the correct value ($557.92), while still properly obeying filtering.The problem I'm having is that I now need to be able to apply that on a per-mailing basis, while still obeying the product filtering. This is where I'm falling apart, as the calculation isn't returning the attribution values (the final total row) in the table above, which was manually calculated.Can anyone point me in the right direction for the correct calculation using this data model?

PHP is ksort() necessary if using array values only individually?,|A simple question today!I've ended up defining the values in my array non-sequentially, in other words 2 =&gt; 'marmosets' is defined before 0 =&gt; cats and 1 =&gt; dogs. It is my understanding is that the keys will assign properly (ie value marmosets will indeed be key 2 not key 0 even though it is defined first), but that my array will be 'out of order' such that a print_r() would output:And that if I want to put them in numerical order by key, ksort() will do that job.(a) Is my understanding correct?(b) If I'm only using these values individually, and never need to output the list, is there any harm/impact in skipping the ksort() and leaving them "out of order"?|,<php><arrays><ksort>

c++ how to assign a default value to a template argument when instantiating the class,|I working on a set of inherited classes, the base is non template, protected constructors and purely virtual methods with no member variables: it serves as a declaration of what the actual inherited template class will and needs to contain.In the inherited version it has only one template argument size_t as this is needed for setting the size of the stored character array so I need to have my class prefixed with template&lt;size_t fixed_size&gt;. It has two private membersone which will contain the size of the string passed in by anyone one of its valid constructors that must except a single parameter. So I was thinking of making this variable a static const size_t and for the other variable which is just a char[] will be set as being [size_t + 1]. What I would like to do is to have the member variable of the static const size_t be set not during instantiation itself, but when its constructor is called and the size would come from the length of the char[], char* or std::string.size() that is passed in from one of its valid constructors. Also when I go to instantiate a class I don't want to do the following: fixed_string&lt;some value&gt; myString( "hello" ); I would rather have it do this instead: fixed_string myString( "hello" ); Here is what my classes currently look like:When I try to compile these are the errors that I'm getting:I kind of understand what the compiler errors are stating but I'm not sure about how to resolve them to finish implementing this class. Are there any newer features of the VS2015 CE compiler that are available that would help me here such as auto or maybe even some lambda techniques? I'm not sure what I'm overlooking.

R - interpolate time series to same interval but new time points,|Apologies if this is an obvious question, but I am new to R, having spent many years with SASI have two data files of measurements taken on 10-second intervals, but not at the exact same time points. I would like to convert one of the time series to match the times of the other, adjusting its values with linear interpolation. In SAS I could do this pretty quickly with proc expand, but I can't find anything similar package in R (I've looked at zoo and xts).To show what I mean, here are snippets of my two files. In this case one time series is on the 3's and the other is on the 2's. In this particular case that 1-second difference is probably trivial, but this is a problem I run into a lot in my work and so I'd like to know if there's any easy way to recalculate, via linear interpolation, the values in the second data set to also be on the 3'sDate,Time,Value3-Nov-16,13:15:53,264.6513-Nov-16,13:16:03,264.583-Nov-16,13:16:13,264.3683-Nov-16,13:16:23,264.2733-Nov-16,13:16:33,264.39111/3/16,1:15:52 PM,10.111/3/16,1:16:02 PM,10.111/3/16,1:16:12 PM,10.111/3/16,1:16:22 PM,10.111/3/16,1:16:32 PM,10.1|,<r><time-series><intervals><linear-interpolation>
Using a Coroutine with a different return type,|In this function, I wanted to get a random index between 0 and the max size of my list.I then use that random index so I can pick a random Node in the list.I go through an if statement and check if other Objects aren't using that random Node I chose.If no other Objects are using that random Node, I return that Node so the Object that called this method can use it.However, if that Node is currently being used by another Object, then I wan't to go through the function again, until it gets a Node it can use, so I return the function itself.The result is an overflow error because it's infinitely called (game still works). My first thought was to use a delay (coroutine), so the function doesn't get called so frequently; but the problem is that I need the return type of type DodgeNode.}I brainstormed how it would look like if I used a coroutine and I thought about this.}Of course this is wrong because I can't return something of type DodgeNode with a function that has a return type of IEnumerator. However, I still want to use WaitForSeconds, so I do need the IEnumerator return type.The problem here is that I want to return a DodgeNode, but at the same I need the function to be of return type IEnumerator for the WaitForSeconds to work.In response to Serlite, here's where I'm using this function (deleted a lot of irrelevant code):}Found my "Solution"Disclaimer: I'm a beginner programmer/studentI got a piece of paper and tried to write out all of my thought process and ended up with an alternate "solution". Rather than trying to attempt to call WaitForSeconds in SelectRandomNode(), I decided to make SelectRandomNode() return null if all Nodes were occupied. In the IEnumerator AttackPlayerNode(), I have this code: Since I'm returning null, this while loop will keep going until a Node is open. This will still generate a overflow error (it should I think), but I am now using WaitForSeconds which will make the check for an open node less frequent, which prevents the overflow error (to my understanding).It's probably a very ugly/temporary solution, but I can always go back for optimization in the future! This was haunting me for a full day and am glad I can focus on other elements of my game now.}|,<c#><unity3d><coroutine>

How to control Volume on Apple Watch Bluetooth Audio,|I recently developed an app that runs on the Apple Watch.

I tried using Siri to control the volume, but that works only when the AirPods are connected to the phone, not the watch. When they are connected to the phone, you can also use phone's own volume controls. I use WKAudioFilePlayer class to play the clips. There does not seem to be any way to control the volume from the software side either.Any ideas?|,<audio><bluetooth><apple-watch><volume>
Creating multiple objects and signals,|first of all: I'm using PyQt5 and Python3.6. The folowing Codepart will clearify the problem:I'm creating a little dropdownmenu, placed in a pushbutton.

Note: The SQL-statement is a little bit weird, because im testing right now. The final statement will be "SELECT name FROM characters", so i get all characters from the table (names are kind of primary key).

realloc(): invalid pointer Error in C,|I realize that this particular question has been beaten to death on here, but I am absolutely lost as to why this error is still occurring for me.Bare in mind that this isn't for an assignment or anything, so whatever logical flaws/errors you may see in my implementation are due to a lack of programming experience; I have none and this is my first attempt at implementing a typical data structure. I'm trying to teach myself programming at the moment so please understand if I'm making any glaring errors anywhere.That said, here is the source for a binary search tree implementation (with some other junk stuff I threw in; I tried to make cin like C++'s cin):So when I run this, the program runs fine as I'm adding in the following tree (in sequence):15, 7, 23, 3, 11, 19, 27.Then, when I add the number 5 to the tree, the program crashes with the titular error. I've tried debugging with both gdb (and lldb), but I don't think that was really effective, even with the -g flag turned on.It doesn't make sense to me since the call to realloc in both update_stack and update_count_stack doesn't fail prior to adding the number 5.I do realize too that it isn't typical or good practice to increase the size of a dynamically allocated memory chunk by 1 over and over again, as it is inefficient, but I just want to know why this is occurring here, and how I might be able to fix it - I feel like I'm just missing something obvious and am pulling my hair out over something minuscule!Thank you very much.EDIT: Thanks for the feedback, everyone.

PHP - file_get_contents() 'SSL: The operation completed successfully.' and 'Failed to enable crypto' at the same time (Google ReCaptcha),|A co-worker's come to me asking for some help figuring this particular error out.

Java Swing Cursor Hotspot Ignored in Windows Game Bar,|I've built a game using java + swing. Some parts of the game have custom cursors that are 32 x 32 pixel images (the process of creating these cursors is shown below). These cursors are offset with a hot-spot to center the cursor. When playing the game, everything looks correct. When recording the game, it appears as if the cursors are off-set. After some trial and error I've determined that the hot-spot is being completely ignored (acts as if the point is (0, 0) always). To clarify the problem is evident when the screen is being recorded, not in normal game-play.Also I'd like to draw attention to the requiresLessOffSet() method. This is a work-around I made to make sure cursors look correct on all devices. This is very annoying that cursors do not do this by default. If any one is curious this problem arises on ASUS Zenbook and possible others.Thanks in advance. If you down-vote please have the decency to explain why.

Is using many fragments a bad practice?,|I have an App which has, let say 15 different sections. I use a single Activity with a FrameLayout where I load 15 different Fragments using a NavigationDrawer. I also have child fragments under few parent Fragments where I load swipe Tab layout.So, in short, I have lots of fragments in my App.The issue is, if I add the fragments to the BackStack while adding to the FrameLayout, the fragments never gets destroyed as long as my App lives (only View gets destroyed, which is expected behavior by design). To make it worse, if the user keep hovering to different Fragments, the size of the BackStack keeps increasing which can result memory issues.So, I started googling and found several threads in SO where some suggests against using Fragments at all. But if I want to design each section using its own Activity, I have to add NavDrawer to each activity (or at least extend those activity to a base activity) which I am not sure if prudent.That leaves to the question, is it a good design to have lots of fragments in a single activity? If it's fine, should I add the fragments to the BackStack? If I should, what about memory issues? And finally, has anybody tried NavigationDrawer across different activities? Is it efficient?My apology for a series of questions.Edit: Based on the responses so far, I want to clarify that, I know it is sort of generic question, and can result different opinion-based responses. So, I want to make it clear that, I am not looking for any decisive answer (becuase there might not be any), rather I wanted to open a discussion to hear from different perspectives.|,<android><android-fragments>

Is Bluetooth OOB pairing really supported in Android?,|I am a complete newbie to the world of Android.Please forgive me if my question is too naive.I have been working on a sample application to realize Bluetooth pairing between a Linux Box (FC-21 running Bluez-5.42) and an Android tablet. I am using NFC to transfer the Bluetooth name, address and OOB data from the PC to Android.I am able to send the above data from PC to Android over NFC (beam to be precise) and I am able to parse and decode all the data at the Android side.With the Bluetooth address of the Linux box available at Android, I can call CreateBond() to pair the Android tablet with Linux Box. I have tested this part and it works as expected.Now, the problem with this method is that, during Bluetooth pairing Numeric comparison or passkey entry association model is used, which I feel is an aberration to the user experience when he is using NFC to do the pairing.Since I already have the OOB data of the PC, I would like to use the OOB association for pairing such that the user experience is not compromised. To do this, when I replace CreateBond() with CreateBondOutOfBand() [using reflection], no pairing request is sent from Android to the Linux PC.I searched online but could not find any concrete evidence that OOB pairing can be implemented in Android.Further, to check the behavior of native Android, I created a NFC tag with the Bluetooth name, address and OOB data of the Linux box. When I held the tag against the Android tablet, Bluettoth pairing was started but it was still not using OOB association model.My questions are as follows,Is OOB association model really supported on Android? If OOB association model is supported, is CreateBondOutOfBand() theAPI to be used or is there any other API that I need to use?Any inputs would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Sai|,<android><bluetooth><nfc>

Hints on Firemonkey not displaying in Delphi Seattle,|It is nice that Firemonkey got again the Hint property for controls, at least in Delphi Berlin and Seattle.However, the implementation seems to be a bit flawed yet.One weird issue is that the displaying of the Hint seems related to the form's BorderIcons property. If the BorderIcons are left with the default values (Maximize, Minimize, SystemMenu), the hint shows. But if I change some of the border icons, the hints don't show any more. I don't see any logic for it, so it looks like a bug. I traced some code in the FMX.Forms unit, but couldn't find any relation to the border icons. The hints in TriggerControlHint and other methods seem to be set correctly. Has anyone had such an issue and have you solved it somehow?There are other issue, like hints not working on a XE8 project converted to Seattle on Windows. It was mentioned in this question Firemonkey Hints don&#39;t work in Delphi Seattle, for a project converted from XE7. I fixed that by recreating the dproj file and it probably has something to do with the default manifests/themes.Also hints for controls placed on a TLayout don't show, because the layout doesn't have the ShowHint property. Doesn't sound very logical to me, but at least it can be overcome by setting each control's ShowHint property manually.The issue is reported on QC as RSP-13218 |,<user-interface><delphi><firemonkey><delphi-10.1-berlin>

JavaFX Abnormally Closing Alert Returns Incorrect Result,|I have created a JavaFX Alert object that returns unexpected results when calling showAndWait. The code below illustrates the behavior I am observing:When I run the above application, two dialogs are shown. Click "Yes" on the first dialog, then close (by clicking the "x" in the upper right corner) the second. By taking the above steps, I expect that the application would print the following: Yes No or ClosedHowever, what I am actually seeing printed is: Yes YesThe Dialog documentation states that an "abnormal closing condition" (such as clicking the small "x" in the upper-right corner) will "attempt to set the result property to whatever value is returned from calling the result converter with the first matching ButtonType." Given the context of this statement, I interpreted "matching ButtonType" to mean a ButtonType that either (direct quote from the documentation):  The button has a ButtonType whose ButtonBar.ButtonData is of type ButtonBar.ButtonData.CANCEL_CLOSE. The button has a ButtonType whose ButtonBar.ButtonData returns true when ButtonBar.ButtonData.isCancelButton() is called. Is my interpretation of the documentation incorrect, or is this a bug in JavaFX? Regardless of why this is not working as I expect, is there any way I can force "abnormal closing conditions" to return ButtonType.NO in this case?|,<java><javafx><dialog><modal-dialog><javafx-8>

Should I be using custom converters for Retrofit?,|I've just started learning about Retrofit 2. I need to consume a RESTful API for an existing Android app. Essentially, the data model for the Android app already exists. I have a REST service which doesn't directly translate to the model classes / properties used by the app (i.e. internally the class properties do not comply with the kind of naming required by Retrofit to work automatically). For example, given a Car object, the API may return make, model and color. The app's internal model has an existing Vehicle class instead, and property names do not directly map. Moreover, there are certain properties that must be initialized in a particular order. I know this qualifies for a Custom Converter but would you suggest I instead look into a custom Gson Deserializer? Would that be a better / easier choice instead? Any guidance would be appreciated as I've just started reading up on Retrofit. I like the fact that I don't have to write all the boilerplate code, yet I feel like I'm unable to utilize its full potential given I need to 'map' all the objects and their properties manually.|,<android><rest><retrofit2>

Nodejs event lifecycle,|I've running in to a problem with Nodejs events, or my lack of understanding thereof and need some help figuring out where I am going wrong.

For example, if I typeThis is some textthen hit return, I get thisThis is some text&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then if I type something, the last &lt;br&gt; is swapped out and I get thisThis is some text&lt;br&gt;Some more textPerfect. Except, if I move the caret back to the end of the first line and hit return, two &lt;br&gt; tags are added, jumping the caret down two spaces.Is there some way to add the &lt;br&gt; tags conditionally, adding two only if the caret is at the end of the text range or something?|,<javascript><jquery><contenteditable>

Docker - How to update images,|I read that docker works with layers, so when creating a container with a Dockerfile, you start with the base image, then subsequent commands run add a layer to the container, so if you save the state of that new container, you have a new image. There are a couple of things I'm wondering about this. If I start from a Ubuntu image, which is pretty big and bulky since its a complete OS, then I add a few tools to it and save this as a new image which I upload to the hub. If someone downloads my image, and they already have a Ubuntu image saved in their images folder, does this mean they can skip downloading Ubuntu since they already have the image? If so, how does this work when I modify parts of the original image, does Docker use its cached data to selectively apply those changes to the Ubuntu image after it loads it?2.) How do I update an image that I built by modifying the Dockerfile? I setup a simple django project with this Dockerfile:and used this to create the image in the beginning. So everytime I create a box, it loads all these environment variables, if I rebuild the box completely it reinstalls the packages and all the extras. I need to add a new environment variable, so I added it to the bottom of the Dockerfile, along with a test variable:When I delete the container and the image, and build a new container, it all seems to go accordingly, it tells me that it creates the new Step 4 : ENV So its like something gets lost in some of these intermediate container transitions. Is this how the caching system works, every new layer is an intermediate container? So with that in mind, how do you add a new layer, do you always have to add the new data at the bottom of the Dockerfile? Or would it be better to leave the Dockerfile alone once the image is built, and just modify the container and built a new image? EDIT I just tried installing an image, a package called bwawrik/bioinformatics, which is a CentOS based container which has a wide range of tools installed.It froze half way through, so I exited it and then ran it again to see if everything was installed:So it definitely installed the package in pieces, not all in one go.

How to single click checkbox in datagrid nested inside a datagrid,|I have nearly googled myself to death on this one. I see a lot of solutions to my problem, but none of them are working... I can only assume it is because I am nesting datagrids with checkboxes at the center. Right now my app takes two clicks to change the check state of a checkbox. I assume the first click is to get focus on the appropriate row? or cell and the second click activates the check state change.Here is my XAML:I have tried setting styles: I no longer have the code behind for any of those associated events to show unfortunately. I have also tried using someone's custom datagrid class references here:This custom class got me the closest. In fact it worked great... until I needed to un-check that checkbox (located in the inner datagrid). There was no way of changing the check state of an already checked box without first switching to another Row of the main datagrid and then back. I fiddled with trying to customize that class even further to get what I wanted but came up short. I should also note that I've tried every solution on the stackoverflow link posted above. Has anyone come across this before? I can post my code-behind if anyone thinks its relevant. Thanks|,<c#><wpf><checkbox><datagrid>

Is it needed to avoid function parameters as non-pod structures?,|So, the question is, should I avoid usage of non-POD structures (for example which contains std::string or smth else) while passing such objects to functions as parameters for initialization other objects?For instance, as well as I know, there are many initialization structures in WinAPI, but they are still POD. Is it a good style to use structures in that way? Or should I use some pattern to avoid this? Am I right that this is some kind of "poltergeist" anti-pattern?Moreover I would like to pass strings and other containers via such structures. It means that this structures appears to be non-POD. For now I would say that I need nearly 20 such initialization-structures.Is it better to create builder pattern instead? In this case it will be the same number of structures, right? In addition I have factories for some objects so for them I can avoid creating addition builder class.What it is preffered way of solving problem of initialization?|,<c++><design-patterns><builder><pod>

Windows 10 Mobile AssignedAccessXml: Disable "related settings" for blocked settings pages,|I am experimenting with locking down a device running Windows 10 Mobile enterprise, using Microsoft EnterpriseAssignedAccess CSP, most specifically AssignedAccess.xml (aka lockdown.xml). I am facing an issue with being able to indirectly access the screens I am trying to block. The configuration only seems to "hide" the setting screen but does not effectively block access to the settings through any other entry points. For instance, if I block access to the "Storage" screen (SettingsPageStorageSenseStorageOverview), it stops showing in the setting menu as expected. However, the Networking &amp; Wireless / Data usage screen contains a "Related Settings" link that opens the Storage screen. This defeats the purpose of attempting to block access to the Storage screen in the first place. Is there a way to disable "Related Settings"?|,<uwp><windows-10-mobile><windows-10-iot-core><lockdown>

Securing a Password in a Background Job in Ruby,I have a access token that is stored encrypted as an ENV variable on a server. When someone wants to generate a report - they send up a password which is used to decrypt the encrypted access token (currently using ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor) then the access token is used to make some API calls to a third party needed to generate the report.The issue I'm running into is the network API call to the third party is slow (a few minutes) and causing web requests to timeout. The project has Sidekiq + ActiveJob integrated and I thought it'd be great to queue a job (then the slow runtime won't matter). I'm unclear now how to properly handle the password. I can't use the password as an argument for the job (since it then gets stored in Redis). Likewise I can't put the decrypted access token (for the same reason). Do I have any options? If the third party let me convert the encrypted access key into a limited use / expiring key via a quick API I could do that prior to enqueueing - but I don't beleive that is an option. Any other options?,<ruby-on-rails><ruby><encryption>

How to write left outer joins in HQL query in Spring Data JPA,|I've a table called "location" where I'm capturing the latitude and longitude of my employees.

Where did "Always use Y-Up axis" in Xcode 8 go?,|We used to have an option "Always use Y-Up axis" toggle in Xcode (until Xcode 7 at least, I think).It's gone in current Xcode 8.2.1, and probably gone since 8.1 or even 8.0. Why? Or is it hiding somewhere else? Any workarounds?Update: I found a related quote from a WWDC speech, way back in 2014: The way you add 3D assets to your game is just SceneKit asset catalogs.  SceneKit asset catalogs are new feature in Xcode 6, SceneKit asset catalogs are new feature in Xcode 6, and they allow you to organize and optimize your 3D assets.  The structure of SceneKit asset catalogs is preserved when they are copied into your target.  Also, they automatically track files that are added to them or removed from them on disc.  They are really convenient because they can optimize your 3D assets for you.  For instance, they help with up axis conversion.  SceneKit follows the up axis conversion, which means that the positive y axis is the one that looks up.  This is a convention that is followed by many other applications and frameworks, but some exporters do things differently and use a z up axis convention.  With SceneKit asset catalogs, you don't have to think about that.  We automatically and transparently convert all the animations and geometries in your scene so that they follow the up axis convention.Taken from Video at https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/610/The above seems to describe the scene kit asset catalog when it was introduced. It doesn't actually answer my question here; why that feature is removed from current Xcode. I can also confirm that no conversion happens behind the scenes. A model exported from Blender is always going to move closer to or away from camera if its Y position is changed. At run-time it is the same.|,<xcode><3d><scenekit>

inputViewController of superview gets called when tapped on subview(UITextView),|I have UIView Subclass to which I have added a UITextField. I have set this view as my Viewcontroller's top view.In the UIViewSubclass, I have overridden inputViewController getter to provide a custom keyboard. When I am selecting the UITextField, I would assume the becomeFirstResponder of UITextField is called and I would see the keyboard associated with it. However, Apart from this, inputViewController method on my UIView Subclass also is getting called causing both the textfield's and the UIView's input view getting shown one on top of another. I also do not see canBecomeFirstResponder or becomeFirstResponder getting called on my UIView's subclass. Only inputViewController method is called and the custom keyboard shows up. Could anyone help me understand why inputViewController is getting called on my UIView's subclass even when it is not becoming first responder. UPDATEFrom apple documentation - "An input view is a substitute for system keyboards that is assigned to the inputView property of a text view or a custom view. When there are input views, UIKit might swap out the keyboard even when a text object is first responder, and it might show a keyboard-like input view on the developer's behalf for non-text objects."So if I understood this correctly, it does make sense for UIResponder to call inputViewController on my UIView subclass but it should ideally have swapped out the textfields keyboard with the inputViewController?

Problems writing to network device using sockets,|I have a wireless device communicating over port 22 connected to my network. Once the device starts up, it immediately starts sending log data. Once this device is sent a command, it stops logging and responds accordingly. This all works, I have tested it using a telnet client.My problem is that I can't seem to send it a command properly in my app. I am reading the log data as planned, but when I send it a command, in this case the command "r", it continues outputting log data instead what it should be showing me for that particular command. This has to mean that I am not properly sending the command. This is my code for the task that sends it the command and logs the output in the android logcat:What am I doing wrong? Why is it not registering the command?UPDATE:I have used several telnet clients for testing, and the server is reading the 'r' command as expected on some. It works using a windows telnet client, and it works using the vSSH app by Velestar.

Tensorflow Custom Cost Function,|I have 2 concrete classes, say A and C.

The cost function should be as follows: A misclassification, (an A classified as C, or vice versa) will have a very large cost. A correct classification will have zero cost. Classifying an item as B will have very low cost. The result is that we only distinguish samples that we are VERY SURE fit into their respective classes. I have only worked through the simple tutorials in TensorFlow, but it didn't cover how to define more specific costs functions such as this.

In this example, we would have classified the second sample as B because we were uncertain, but the true class was C. |,<python><tensorflow><neural-network>

Calculate bias and variance in ridge regression MATLAB,|I can't get my mind around the concept of how to calculate bias and variance from a random set. I have created the code to generate a random normal set of numbers.and then extract the y valuesAfter that I split my data into a training (100) and test (500) setThen I calculated the w for a specific value of lambda (1.2)Finally, I am computing the square error:I know that if I create a vector of lambda (I have already done that) over some iterations I can plot the average MSE_train and MSE_test as a function of lambda, where then I will be able to verify that large differences between MSE_test and MSE_train indicate high variance, thus overfit. But, what I want to do extra, is to calculate the variance and the bias^2. Taken from Ridge Regression Notes at page 7, it guides us how to calculate the bias and the variance. My questions is, should I follow its steps on the whole random dataset (600) or on the training set? I think the bias^2 and the variance should be calculated on the training set. Also, in Theorem 2 (page 7 again) the bias is calculated by the negative product of lambda, W, and beta, the beta is my original w (w = randn(10,1)) am I right? Sorry for the long post, but I really want to understand how the concept works in practice. UPDATE 1:Ok, so following the previous paper didn't generate any good results.

plpython recursive on Windows but not Linux?,|I have a dev system that is based on postgresql that manages organizational structures.

Unfortunately the system error message doesn't provide a lot of detail.

C++ templates long type lists,|I am writing a C++ library that relies heavily on type parameterizations. So far, four types are parameterized through the library. Importantly, not every type is used by every library component (i.e. sets of related classes). In the below illustration of the problem, it is critical that Component2 is independent of type C. Notice in the below snippet that type-compatible instances of Component1 can be obtained from incompatibile instances of Component3, because type D is erased through the build_something() call. It would not be possible to use the same list of four types for all class templates, given this requirementOf course, repeating all these type lists becomes unweildy. I have chosen to provide function definitions outside of class bodies (even though the classes are templates). Also, type names are actually whole words in the library implentation, not single letters. Finally, each class in this example is a stand-in for a set of classes in the actual library. There are many classes, though all are type-parameterized according to one of these schemes. More schemes my be added later. The effect is that the code, especially in method prototypes, is very dense, and difficult to maintain and even to read.I am looking for a solution to these problems that is clear, effective, and consistent with convention. I am considering the below solution, but I am wondering whether a clearer, more effective, or more conventional solution is available.My candidate solution is to group related types into template "metatype", illustrated below in types1 and types2:It would then be possible to extract the lower-level types from the high-level composite types (although simply putting typdefs in the metatypes is also effective):Then the following assert holds, because get_A fetches the A constituent from the types1 composition:This system makes it simpler to define class internals, with some added difficulty in the function calls that unify the disparate schemes. One serious problem is, absent language-level contraints for concepts (e.g. Concept Lite), it is not possible simply to look at the class template definitions and know what is supposed to into the types template parameter. There are of course other issues that make this approach far from a perfect resolution.Is there a better way?|,<c++><templates><metaprogramming>
How to have a VIP for 2 servers ( Prod and Dr ),|We have prod and dr servers, we would like to have VIP for them. They are not exposed to internet.

What is wpilibj 2017 replacement method for initDigitalPort?,|I've come into a little problem with some legacy code from the 2016 control system. I'm trying to control the adis16448 board with this librarywhich compiled fine in the 2016 wpilibj, but doesn't compile in the 2017 version. Now, I'd like to get this up and running quickly without having to wait for the dev to update, and there are actually only two errors.Relevant code here:First is that the InterruptSource class has some unimplemented methods from the parent class. I just added empty definitions for these and that error obviously went away. Next is that the method initDigitalPort is not defined from the parent class. This is the part that I get stuck on. Upon examination of the API Javadoc, the Source Code on github, and the context of this code, I still can't seem to figure out what this does or how to fix it. I'm guessing this has been depreciated in the 2017 wpilibj library. My question is, what is the replacement method for initDigitalPort? Forgive me for anything simple I've overlooked, we are a new FRC team so we have 0 experience with using wpilibj. Also, it might help if I understood what the DigitalSource class actually does, it seems to involve encoders but that can't be right since this board has none.

Implement Command History within Java Program?,|I need some coding advice. I've written a simple Java program which runs within one of my company's internal websites. Its a command line program where users enter commands like copy file1 to remote1 and compare file1 to file2 archive diff and so on. My colleagues like it and use it frequently.The problem is the users' commands tend to be long and repetitive. They have asked me if it is possible to implement a command history in the program. This way, they can use the up arrow or something to scroll through, edit, and resubmit previous commands. There's no need to remember commands entered in previous sessions, only the current session.I've thought about it, and I think I could come up with a solution from scratch... but it would take a few weeks to develop. I'd much rather implement an available package or module, if one exists and isn't too much trouble. I know this is an open-ended question, but can anyone recommend such a resource?|,<java><package>

CNN Object Localization Preprocessing?,|I'm trying to use a pretrained VGG16 as an object localizer in Tensorflow on ImageNet data.

I'm not trying to do anything fancy here (sliding windows, RCNN), just get some mediocre results.I'm sort of new to this and I'm just confused about the preprocessing done here for localization. In the paper, they say that they scale the image to 256 as its shortest side, then take the central 224x224 crop and train on this. I've looked all over and can't find a simple explanation on how to handle localization data.Questions: How do people usually handle the bounding boxes here?... Do you use something like the tf.sample_distorted_bounding_box command, and then rescale the image based on that?Do you just rescale/crop the image itself, and then interpolate the bounding box with the transformed scales? Wouldn't this result in negative box coordinates in some cases?How are multiple objects per image handled?Do you just choose a single bounding box from the beginning ,crop to that, then train on this crop?Or, do you feed it the whole (centrally cropped) image, and then try to predict 1 or more boxes somehow?Does any of this generalize to the Detection or segmentation (like MS-CoCo) challenges, or is it completely different?Anything helps...Thanks|,<machine-learning><tensorflow><computer-vision><neural-network><conv-neural-network>

HTML5 Context Menu with Pug,|There currently appears to be a bug in Pug/Jade, in which &lt;menuitem&gt; is treated as self-closing, when in reality, they need to be closed.

Otherwise, this would cause LinkedIn to be the only option that appears under "Visit me on..." The closest example I could find to this was this StackOverflow question, which suggested using plain HTML, and while this works, I am wondering if there is a Pug-only alternative.

Python: detecting alternates in bipartite graph,|I'm looking for either an existing library function from some Python library or a custom Python function using numpy or pandas that is fast, that does the following: takes as input a list of edges in a bipartite graph and returns the subset of the edges that are part of alternating paths of length >= 3, excluding the 2 end edges for that alternating path.For example, from the following graph:The input would be:[[B,1],[C,2],[A,2],[C,3],[D,2],[D,3],[E,3],[E,4]]and the output would be:[[C,2],[D,3],[E,3]]In other words, if and edge is part of an alternating path with length &lt; 3, then it is excluded (e.g. [B-1]). Also, for alternating paths of length >=3, only the non-end edges are included. So e.g. [A,2] and [C,3] are not included, and [D,2] and [E,4] are not included.Right now I'm creating the incidence matrix for the blue and red node sets, and then looking at the 1 entries. Those entries that are 1's that are in a row with a rowsum > 1 and in a column with a columnsum > 1 are the connections I'm looking for. But this method of creating an incidence matrix seems too slow so I'm hoping there is a faster solution. P.S. I know I can easily make a sparse incidence matrix from 2 columns in Pandas like so:But the problem is that the cardinalities of my blue and red node sets are large, and I get memory errors when the cardinalities are > 50000. So instead right now I'm iteratively building each row of the sparse incidence matrix and then looking at the 1's as described earlier. But if there were a fast way of examining the alternating paths in the bipartite graph without building the incidence matrix that would be an excellent solution.|,<python><pandas><numpy><scipy><bipartite>
Worker blocking UI thread in Chrome,|I'm building a web app that uses EvaporateJS to upload large files to Amazon S3 using Multipart Uploads. I noticed an issue where every time a new chunk was started the browser would freeze for ~2 seconds. I want the user to be able to continue to use my app while the upload is in progress, and this freezing makes that a bad experience.I used Chrome's Timeline to look into what was causing this and found that it was SparkMD5's hashing. So I've moved the entire upload process into a Worker, which I thought would fix the issue.Well the issue is now fixed in Edge and Firefox, but Chrome still has the exact same problem.Here's a screenshot of my Timeline:As you can see, during the freezes my main thread is doing basically nothing, with &lt;8ms of JavaScript running during that time. All the work is occurring in my Worker thread, and even that is only running for ~600ms or so, not the 1386ms that my frame takes.I'm really not sure what's causing the issue, are there any gotchas with Workers that I should be aware of?Here's the code for my Worker:Note that it relies on the calling thread to provide it with the AWS Public Key, AWS Bucket Name and AWS Region, AWS Object Key and the input File object, which are all provided in the 'init' message.

Trouble using a IF condition and comparing values between two different workbooks,|So I have a number of CSV file that contain a month worth of hourly data.

In this new workbook, each CSV file will have it's own sheet, and in the new sheet the hourly data will be converted to daily totals.My code so far does all of the above, except for the proper calculation. I get the daily total by adding that hour's value to a blank variable for each row if that particular hour belongs in the day in question. (eg - the value for 1/12/2016 11:00 will be added to the destination column corresponding to 1/12:2016).However, my source sheet is a CSV file in a folder, and my destination is a excel file newly created. My code does everything right, except for the calculation. My logic is accurate. So possibly the problem is that I'm not carrying my values through correctly.I would really appreciate it if someone can tell me what im doing wrong here. this is only a small extract of the code, but i think it's the relevant bit. I have defined everything at the start.So this doesnt throw any errors. Except the value of x is always just zero, so it writes zeros to the destination sheet. to reiterate, the source sheet is an CSV file. Destination sheet is a seperate file.More confusingly, as seen in the code, it imports the headings just fine. the data also corresponds with what I'm trying to import, so it should make the connections, which its not.I am very new to VBA, so please excuse my coding.

Using Rolify in conjunction with (or in place of) join tables for many-to-many relationships,|I'm trying to figure out the best way to design some of the db relationships for my application. I have a number of relationships that are many-to-many. Here is an example of one such relationship:So this will allow me to define what users belong to what groups. However, I also need to know what their access level to a group is. So in the groups_users table I have extra attributes, like admin, contributor, etc. If I wanted to make a user the admin of a group, I'd do something likeThis whole setup works fine but I've been looking into using Rolify and it seems like it could be applicable in this situation. Rolify allows me to set a user's role for an instance of a class, so to do the above I would do this:I like the idea of Rolify so I figured I could do this and get rid of the extra attributes in the join table. But now I'm feeling like I'm kinda mixing and matching since I'm using the join table to get what groups a user has (u.groups) but then I need to use Rolify to get their access level for each group somehow. Maybe that's the way to do it... but it occurred to me that I could just use Rolify and get rid of the join tables altogether. I just add a "base" role so to speak, like :member. So instead of using u.groups to get a users groups I would do Group.with_role(:member, u). I wouldn't have the ability to do stuff like u.groups = [g1, g2, g3] but I was already going to have to mess with that a bit in order to set the users access levels for each group.So I guess I'm just looking for recommendations as to how to do this. I have a number of many-to-many relationships involving users and I like the idea of using Rolify to handle all of that so I don't have a bunch of join tables and classes, but as someone who is new to Rolify (and not an expert in this stuff to begin with) I'm not sure if I'm missing some pitfalls with this approach.|,<ruby-on-rails><activerecord><database-design><associations><rolify>

Meteor Collection 2 Re-Use Array Items From Same Collection for AutoForm,|I have a collection with a few arrays. I am using autoform to display various forms. I need to pull in the existing data from the same _id into a different form field. Here is my document with data: { "_id": "ERjvecg2GmSBktmn5", "clientName": "General Motors", "clientInfo": [ { "fullname": "John Smith", "email": "jsmith@gmail.com", "phone": 2485551212, "phone2": 7345551212 }, { "fullname": "Billy Bob", "email": "bbob@gmail.com", "phone": 3135551212, "phone2": 7346661212 } ], "facilityList": [ { "name": "GM @ Ann Arbor", "id": "1234", "facilityType": "option1", "address": "12345 Main St Ann Arbor, MI 48888", "contacts": [ { "contactName": "Jill Sutton", "contactEmail": "jsutton@gmail.com", "contactPhone1": 7348881212, "contactPhone2": 3132224444 } ], "special": "gsgfsdgdsgdsgdgsdgsdgdgdgggdsgfdgdfgdgsdgsdg", "_id": "accde038-775d-4d11-b8fd-d0cc3b63c869" } ], "TasksWithData": [ { "inspectionDetails": [ { "inspector": "cHsSP6jadYa8wAeTi", "inspectorName": "Joe Reporter", "projectType": "inspection", "startDate": "2017-01-13T05:30:00.000Z", "desc": "fgfsdgsdgsdgdsgsdgdggsdgdg", "activeTask": false } ], "TaskItem": [ { "DataFacilitySection": "dsfgsdfgds", "DataItemDescription": "item 1", "DataItemSection": "dfgdfgdf", "DataItemCode": "dfgdfgdf", "DataItemPass": null }, { "DataFacilitySection": "ftydftuydrtuy", "DataItemDescription": "item 2", "DataItemSection": "dfgdgdf", "DataItemCode": "dfgdfgdf", "DataItemPass": null } ], "author": "Ss6TjGGzqWJRZYStx" } ]}Really what I need to do is get the "facilityList" objects to appear as options in a select. I have managed to do this with data from other collections like so:  'TasksWithData.$.inspectionDetails.$.inspector': { type: String, label: "Inspector", optional: true, autoform: { firstOption: 'Choose an Inspector', options: function() { return Meteor.users.find({}, { sort: { profile: 1, firstName: 1 } }).map( function ( c ){ return{ label: c.profile.firstName + " " + c.profile.lastName, value: c._id }; } ); } } },but it seems a bit different when doing it with items from the same _id. Here is my autoForm: {{#autoForm collection="ClientData" id=UpdateForm type="update-pushArray" scope="TasksWithData" doc=this}}{{&gt; afQuickField name="inspectionDetails.0.TaskFacility"}}{{&gt; afQuickField name="inspectionDetails.0.inspector"}}{{&gt; afQuickField name="inspectionDetails.0.inspectorName"}}{{&gt; afQuickField name="inspectionDetails.0.projectType"}}{{&gt; afQuickField name="inspectionDetails.0.startDate"}}{{&gt; afQuickField name="inspectionDetails.0.desc"}}&lt;div class="panel panel-default"&gt; {{&gt; afArrayField name="TaskItem"}}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;input class="btn btn-primary btn-block" type="submit" value="Add Task"&gt;{{/autoForm}}I am a little unsure if this would get done on the autoform side or with the schema. Here is an example of the schema I am using to attempt to pull in the data: 'TasksWithData.$.inspectionDetails.$.TaskFacility': { type: String, label: "Choose a Facility", optional: true, autoform: { firstOption: 'Choose a Facility', options: facilityList },Clearly its wrong, but I would REALLY appreciate suggestions on this. |,<mongodb><meteor><meteor-autoform><simple-schema><meteor-collection2>

In the benchmarking trials, the replace falls farther back in the ranks while the tidyr replace_na() wins (by a nose) Running the singular tests repeatedly and on different shapes and sizes of data frames always finds the base replace() in the lead. Question 2: How could it's benchmark performance be the only result that falls so far out of line with the simple test results?More perplexingly - Question 3: How can all the mutate_all/_at(replace()) work faster than the simple replace()?Many folks report this:  (and all the links in that article) but I still haven't found an explanation for why beyond that hashing and C++ are used.)with special thanks already to Tyler Rinker: https://www.r-bloggers.com/microbenchmarking-with-r/and akrun: |,<r><dplyr>

Send Json of ResultSet over Restful services without using POJO class or by using just 1 POJO class,|I'm trying to implement restful services which will send Json from ResultSet of PostgreSQL, I was able to send by mapping resultset to a POJO class using Jersey and I dont want to use any other library like Gson, but I would like to send resultset directly as Json without the intermediate POJOs as I'm not in need of POJOs for any other purpose, I'm not very much familiar with servlets or restfull or JAXB, etcI was able to create a custom JsonArray(of Javax.json) from ResultSet without POJO class and convert toString and send String on service, as of now for numbers, strings, dates, timestamps(can even try and do for arrays using recursion, didn't write Custom MessageBodyWriter but can write simple ones, may be even pretend even to write for this) but didn't understand perfectly whether what i'm doing is right way of doing or not and how to handle all data types of PostgreSQL to Json and send over Rest.Please give me suggestions of what are the ways to implement this, andPlease comment little advance things and how they are inter related more clearly on Jersey, JAXB, JAX-RS, for e.g., like how a POJO is getting converted to Json internally, where is that MessageBodyWriter which is converting.Kindly give me suggestion related to jersey and not other libraries.Thank you.Please find the below code I have written and suggest me even improvements.Resource Class :Service Class :PostgreServices : DatabaseHelper :SerializableJSONArray Code, I'm writting this class code just for knowing whether its gonna work or not by the commenters :|,<json><rest><jersey><jax-rs>

Continue vibrating even when the screen times out,|I have a small application that does the following. It counts down from 5 to 1 in vibrations.

Web Speech API lag. Is my code bad or is this to be expected?,|I'm trying to implement speech synthesis in-browser for a home automation project for visually-impaired people. In my test page I've noticed there's a roughly 1-second lag between calling the speak() method and actually hearing it.Just wondering whether this is normal behaviour or if I'm doing something wrong. If anyone can offer advice on how to speed it up (even by half a second or so) I'd really appreciate it :)[EDIT 1]Okay, so I've tried my test page in MS Edge (had only been using Chrome) and the lag disappears. I also tried the Web Speech Synthesis Demo in Chrome, with "voice" set to "native" and there was no lag either. Both these tests rendered the text with a UK English voice. In Chrome, my test page renders the text with an Australian-English voice (I'm in AU), and has a lag before playing.My gut tells me that Chrome browser is loading a voice from some remote location instead of using the local system voice, and only for this specific page (ie the demo at codepen.io works fine in the same browser). But what I don't know is why.This wouldn't be so much of a problem if it only loaded the voice once rather than every single time it is called (I'm just presuming that's what's happening).[/EDIT 1]Here's my code:|,<javascript><text-to-speech><webspeech-api>

Create text/calendar type email that triggers accept/reject/ignore options,|I can programmatically create an email with an .ics file attached.

When the user previews the message it detects that its calendar type and throws a prompt asking the user to take some action. This action decides if it gets pushed into the calendar.

All edges must be parallel to the X or Y axis.

I don't know if this is really necessary, but it makes centering the output easier. Walk out from the center C and for each room R encountered, assign a coordinate (X, Y), where P is the path connecting C=>R resulting in the greatest displacement on the coordinate plane, X is the net horizontal movement along P, and Y is the net vertical movement along P.Assume the following vectors for directions: North = [0,1] South = [0,-1] East = [1,0] West = [-1,0]|,<algorithm><graph><path><shortest-path><undirected-graph>

|WPF baml bug: EventSetter in static resource being set twice, second time to null|,|If I try to store a collection of SetterBase objects in xaml, that includes and EventSetter, The xaml loader throws an error.The root cause is that the xaml loader tries to set PresentationFramework.dll!System.Windows.EventSetters.Event twice: the first time to the correct value (ButtonBase.Click RoutedEvent) but the second time to null, and this throws an exception. My attached property callback is not involved.Why does it try to add the event to the EventSetter twice and why is it null the second time? I checked that the ctor being used is the default one so, EventSeetter is not interacting with the collection in any unusual way, so that's not it. The actual reason is a bug in wpf that fluffs the challenge of parsing the two-part structure of an event (Event and EventHandler).ViewThe code behind is only InitializeComponent and a stub for the event handler. The error occurs during InitializeComponent. BehaviourErrorDebuggingI set a function breakpoint at System.Windows.EventSetter.Event with an action to log the value passed to the setter...Then I run the app and check the output window and can see that the setter was hit twice, first time with the correct value, second time with value null...The working example can be found in the solution in this GITHub Repo in the project called EventSetterNull-SO-41604891-2670182bamlBy setting a BP in the Index member of XamlNodeList I could catch the xaml symbols associated with the SetterBaseCollection xaml object...The Bug?The baml nodeList looks strange, first of all there is an extra Event member starting at idx [20] and this member is actually a System.NullReferenceException.This is being passed to the XamlObjectWriter which is in turn passed to the EventSetter property and this is the cause of the error.The baml then carries on as expected, showing the handler member and properly terminating the members and objects.ConclusionThe problem is in the conversion from xaml to baml so I would say it's a bug. Albeit an avoidable edge case.Work-aroundInstead of trying to set the event in the style, use an attached property in a parent object. For example ButtonBase.Click="StyleClick" in a StackPanel will deliver the behaviour to everything clicky which is what I was originally trying to do. Collections of Property Setters can still be set in a static resource and consumed by attached property-based behaviours.Further research on root causeThe problem is that an event property has two elements: the event and the handler. When the Baml2006Reader parses an object in the baml, it needs to allow for it's structure to ensure it is in the correct state to faithfully interpret the object members. To do this, it has a state machine, driven from a while loop in ReadObject, called Process_OneBamlRecord. This method decodes the next xamlNodeType and calls the appropriate method to parse it and write it as an object. One of these methods is called Process_Property and it has special logic hard-wired into it to handle the event complex in the baml. The problem is that, if the event is recorded in the baml as a Process_PropertyWithConverter, this method is not aware of the special requirements for an event and stuffs everything up. The event handler is prefixed with a property tag (most likely the event parser was meant to recurse and use the same syntax for this sub-structure) and because there has been no EndMember, StartMember state change, the handler sub-property is interpreted by ReadObject as an Event property. And the event setter object that's being created throws an error because it's Event property is already set.|,<wpf><visual-studio-2013><staticresource><eventsetter>

Here is the reference to that endpointhttps://developer.walmartapis.com/#bulk-createupdate-itemsHTTP RESPONSE META INFO500 Internal Server ErrorxmlHTTP RESPONSEHTTP REQUEST:urlhttps://marketplace.walmartapis.com/v2/feeds?feedType=itemmethod POSTrequest headersPOST payload (just text, no key for the parameter)NOTES:I tried using Google' Advanced REST Client Application as well as POSTMAN when making http requests, in order to rule out issues stemming from my code.I've tried tweaking everything that came to mind.I got other endpoints having GET requests to work, so I know it's not an issue with authentication, IP, firewall, or anything like that.I know the credentials generated by the jar file provided by walmart (see the authentication section of the documention https://developer.walmartapis.com/#jar-executable-recommended ) has to be fed the url you're sending to. So I know it's not an issue of generating the wrong key with the jar file.HYPOTHESES:Based on the response, something must be wrong with the data or headers I'm sending. Couldn't determine the boundary from the message!sounds like the xml is doesn't have balanced tags, but I've validated this xmlThe walmart api documentation for this endpoint says to use the header Content-Type: multipart/form-data;. So I did, results in the failure response.But using this header doesn't seem to make sense to me, since the payload body is an xml string. Shouldn't it be Content-Type: application/xml? I tried this too, but it failed with the failed response above (500, SYSTEM_ERROR.GMP_GATEWAY_API, Couldn't determine the boundary from the message!)So it seems Content-Type: application/xml can be ruled out.The walmart api documentation gives example of only how to change product id or sku, but not for creating. I assume I just omit the xml tags specific to updating product id or sku, but that xml payload also results in the 500 response.I'm out of ideas, has anyone else gotten bulk create/update items to work?Anyone have example code that actually works?|,<http-post><walmart-api>

Finding the list of successors of an Instruction in LLVM,|I want to get the list of successors for each instruction in llvm.

How to use forestFloor() on randomForest output from caret package?,|I've been using the forestFloor package to visualize random forest model structure.

refreshing the whole listview except the row which i selected,|I have dynamically created rows in my list view.

So, when a user selects "Partial" on one and there is a previously marked radio button as "partial", it should unselect the previous radio button and also reset the number mentioned to the previous one before updating through the dialog box .

BigQuery client library throwing NPE when setting 'dryRun' to true,|According to the documentation for the dryRun field in the BigQuery API, when set to true, the query will not be executed, but instead will validate it and return some basic statistics: [Optional] If set to true, BigQuery doesn't run the job.

Windows 10 UWP App build issue with MakeAppx,|I am not sure what is causing this error and I have been researching it for hours. I am using Visual Studio 2015 Update 3. I am building a Windows 10 Universal (UWP) app that will be uploaded to the store. I already have my dev center account and it is associated with my app. Finally, when I right click on the project and select store > create app packages I get this error: error 80080204: The package with file name "PacTracMobile.Windows10_1.3.0.0_ARM.appx" and package full name "OdenIndustriesInc.9510B3DEAC6_1.3.0.0_arm__bdbevzbp0ydz4" is not valid in the bundle because the bundle also contains the package with file name "PacTracMobile.Windows10_1.3.0.0_x86.appx" and package full name "OdenIndustriesInc.9510B3DEAC6_1.3.0.0_arm__bdbevzbp0ydz4" which applies to the same processor architecture. Bundles can't contain multiple app packages for the same processor architecture, or an architecture-neutral app package with any architecture-specific app package.This error is with file MakeAppx for the record. I am trying to build x86, x64 and ARM. When I am in debug, I can build, deploy and test just fine, with no errors. However, when I select to build my app packages, I get this. Note, Visual Studio is in Release mode, Any CPU. That said, when I select to create app packages, in the first popup window, I have selected to build each three platform, in release. My screen looks just like this:When I click create, it starts to build and eventually, I get the error above.Any thoughts?Thanks!!!EDIT- For the record, the screen shot I show above, I got from these instructions from Microsoft. I have and am following these instructions exactly! MSDN Building UWP appsUPDATE- If, in the window in the screenshot above, I deselect x84 and x64 (which is not ideal since I want all three) and just do ARM, I don't get any errors and package completes. Based on some reading, I suspect that if I do one by one (ie, run again with only x86 selected), it will build fine but I will be left with three app packages instead of all in one. So, this seems to be related to trying to build all three at one time and package into one bundle which is sort of what the error is eluding to but again, the error nor anything I read online explains how to fix the issue.|,<.net><visual-studio-2015><windows-store-apps><uwp><windows-10-universal>

In an index.php file with mostly HTML code I have multiple &lt;span&gt; elements acting as buttons with class="delete_this":When any &lt;span&gt; element (technically any) with class="delete_this" is clicked, a jQuery AJAX request is made:So, the user clicks on &lt;span class="delete_this"&gt;, then: (1) a variable is defined and (2) the AJAX is requested, sending as data the value of that variable.Now, in validate_existence.php I want a conditional statement to be made, using if () {}. The criteria to be tested is if the variable $count sent in the AJAX request is equal to 1:The problem is the code in // condition not met inside index.php is always run, even if the criteria wasn't met (A.K.A. $_POST['quantity_of_products'] /= 1).I'm most likely missing something in the validate_existence.php file, or using function(html) incorrectly in index.php.|,<javascript><php><jquery><ajax><dynamic>

nginx - How to remove a subdirectory from the url before passing to a script?,|This has been asked on SO before but the answers have not been generalized. So here goes.I have two different web apps. They were made to be on different servers at the root. But now they are going to be placed into subdirectories on the same server. The script below is sending the subdirectory along with the URI's to the scripts. This is a problem.old urls:new urls:The store site is seeing /store/items/1 when it wants to just see /items/1. The same goes for the backoffice site.My attempt:Again, the store site is getting URLs with the /store prefix and backoffice is getting /backoffice. Those sites were coded to not expect those prefixes. I need to remove the /store and /backoffice prefix before sending to the actual site.Is this a rewrite rule thing?I tried this based on this SO page and it didn't work. I must not understand something about the syntax.UpdateApparently, this works (added break;) Is this a complete solution?|,<nginx><url-rewriting>

List box fully enclosed in div element,|I have a web page that I prefer to keep as one page using ajax. The page has two columns with the right column being the active section. Using PHP and Jquery, I make a MySQL call to my database and display a table in the right column. This table has a section that displays stored list names. What I would like to do is then clear the div that has the table, and show a list box dynamically using a new query from list name in the table. I would prefer not to have to view it in a new page. The problem is everything I've read for the past three days just shows existing HTML with the list already in place and then the data is filled dynamically. Is it possible to show ALL of a list box code dynamically? My table can easily take up most of the page so this is not desirable. If not, is it then possible to have a model Listbox popup? Use a second page that has the Listbox and show that in my first form? Nothing I have read gives me real insight into what I need. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.|,<php><jquery>

How to change arrays using void functions in C?,|I just started trying to learn C a couple days ago by following along with the K&amp;R book. I am not totally new to programming but I would say I am a novice. I've been doing mostly fine so far but I've been having a lot of trouble with array manipulation. In section 2.8 of the book, it defines a function called squeeze which takes in an array of characters and a single character and removes all instances of the single character from the array. I was confused at first because this was a void function.I implemented it into my own C program and, when I call the function in Main, it just prints my original array without altering it. I am reasonably sure that this is because I am not changing the array s[] with the Squeeze function before I call printf, but rather changing a copy of the array that isn't being used. I have researched using pointers to refer to arrays in C but I am still very confused on how to do that correctly, because no matter what I try I either get a segment error or the array is not changed. Can anyone help me understand how pointers and arrays work in this context?EDIT: I did originally state the name of the parameter in the function prototype and declaration, but I made an error in copying it.|,<c><arrays><pointers><pass-by-reference><void>

ScrollTop not working in React Component or inspector,|I'm trying to implement an infinite scrolling but I can't get document.body.scrollHeight or window.scrollY or window.pageYOffset to work in my app. I've tried it by inspecting wikipedia and other sites and it works fine, but for some reason it just doesn't work in my React app. Can anyone help?Inspection - React - FailInspection - Other apps e.g. Wikipedia - WorksApp logging - React - FailI've since tried finding this scrollY property in other React applications but still nothing.

jQuery getScript() not working in IE11,|In an HTML5 app I'd like to defer the loading of some big JavaScript files to give faster UI control to the user.Using Still waits until the script loads before turning things over to the user when I set the throttle to 2G and watch the network traffic in Chrome developer tools.I've had success executing the following after the page finishes loading: (The success dialog is just for seeing that the script finished loading for testing purposes)This works perfectly well in Chrome, FireFox, and Opera. Heck it even works fine on the Windows 10 Edge browser and Safari on a really old iPhone. It just will not load the script on IE11. I can step into the minified jQuery code, to see that it runs. It doesn't throw any errors and doesn't download the script.I've searched high and wide here and elsewhere on the web but haven't found any answers. The closest I found was this post but I am not attaching it to any events -- I'm firing it in my own ajax startup routines and it is definitely running. Just not on IE11.If anyone has experience with this I'd appreciate the help. Even if it's a different approach all together. I just don't want to have my users wait to download a 400K script library on slower connections before the UI pops.

Getting Google Cloud SDK site online,|So I've been following Udacity's Web Development Course(CS253) and I managed to follow along up until Lesson 2's Problem Set. The instructor basically tells you to create a website that uses ROT13 to convert the input the user gives in a HTML form(Hello becomes Urryb for instance. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMGNwoFHfB4 this is the Youtube video if it helps). Now the problem was, I had managed to create the function to convert the input, and I had created the layout of the website, but I could not figure out how to get the input the user was providing in the HTML form and store it in a variable so that I could convert it.Since I am using Python,I checked the forum and found out I had to use something called CGI. I tried to use it but my site is hosted locally(I'm accessing it through localhost on my browser), and the guy who posted the answer said the site should be hosted online. My question is, how would I get the site online? I already have another site hosted on a free host(Hostinger) but it only uses HTML and CSS, without needing the Google Cloud SDK. To start the Google Cloud site I have to open CMD, navigate to the folder where my main.py is and type "dev_appserver.py app.yaml". How would I do this on the host?Moreover, how would I install the Google Cloud SDK on the host? This is my MainPage handler if it helps:|,<python><html><google-app-engine>

How would I take the sum of different paths in a graph with Haskell,| Problem  relatedQuestions calculates the question with the shortest reading time. Given the number of questions, an array of each questions reading time, and and array of edges between questions.   To calculate the "shortest reading time" of a question you need to take the sum of reading times of each path a child node makes and divide it by the number of direct children the question has (question being the current node). Then add this number to the current questions reading time.  Ex using inputs above:Issue and RequestMy code works for the given test cases below, but it may fail for others. My code depends on Data.Graph's reachable to get all nodes that a current node can reach and sum all its children divided by the total direct children, but I need to divide each individual child nodes tree sum by the total direct children. So what I'm doing is taking the sum of all paths and dividing by the number of direct children when I should be dividing each path sum.I want to use Data.Graph's component function to fold the tree accordingly and accumulate the smallest sum. I was having issues with working on a Forest Vertex type, but using sequence I got a type of Tree [Vertex] making it a bit easier for me to work with regardless I have not been able to wrap my mind around the recursion/traversing necessary.I'd really appreciate some help on either optimizing my current code to be a full solution or explanations on how I can use Data.Graph's component function to fold/traverse a [Forest Vertex].Test Cases|,<haskell><graph><functional-programming>

How to show date in php. using getFormatDateTime and strtotime,|Before I start I should mention that I have no knowledge about coding, so please bear with me if my question doesn't make sense.I bought a plugin for taxi reservation for wordpress. everything works fine except that when the user picks the date after checking out in woocommerce the reservation date and time was changed to: 01-01-1970 12:00 AM and therefore all dates were shown wrong in emailed receipts and well as woocommerce orders section. Since the author is not providing any support on this I had to dig into it myself and I noticed it's using the following to show the date after checkout:$dateTimePickUp = date(getFormatDateTime("php"),strtotime(WC()-&gt;session-&gt;get_post_meta( $order_id , 'dateTimePickUp', true )));Since this was not working I used the code the was used before checkout: $dateTimePickUp = date(getFormatDateTime("php"),strtotime(WC()-&gt;session-&gt;get( 'dateTimePickUp' )));Now everything is fine except that in woocommerce orders section I'm getting a Fetal error.

Replace repeating delimiters in a text file with an alternate character,|I am attempting to process a large pipe "||" delimited, double quote qualified text file (>700,000 records, >3,000 characters per record, and 28 fields per record). using a python script. I am encountering a problem as the csv parser is parsing fields incorrectly due to unescaped double quote characters and pipes embedded within the text of a field in the file. Since tabs are not present in the file I would like to convert it to a tab delimited file by replacing the double-quote-pipe-double-quote delimiter/qualifier character sequence ("||") with tabs (\t). This would be relatively straightforward if every field was populated but some are not. Fields that are not populated are represented by a null string so I can have anywhere from 1 to 7 pipe delimiters in sequence prefaced by a double quote.a simple example is:a more representative example is:I have been attempting to write a regex that will replace each pipe character/double quote combination or sequence of pipe characters immediately preceded and followed by a double quote 1 for 1 with TAB characters. I have found numerous regex examples for replacing a repeating string with a single character but none that replace a series of repeating characters with an equal length string of an alternate character.I tried the following regex: "\||{1,}" which works for a single pipe char but replaces multiple pipes in sequence with a single TAB. I also need to handle the following related aspects:remove start of line/double quote (^")remove double quote/end of line ("$)and replace double quote/pipe (1 or more)/end of line (eg. "\||$) with an equal number of TAB characters as there are pipe charactersoutput records after application of the regex would look as follows using \t to represent TAB characters:i am open to solving this either in python or in linux using sed or awk|,<python><regex><linux>

Diff hereI am curious on given Open does exactly same things as OpenAsync, what is the advantage of using the async version(if any)?Details:This is how I create the connectionThis code block takes 13 seconds on an average for 100 concurrent calls. I have tried increasing the thread pool count to 200 to reduce chances of tasks waiting for threads. The observation doesn't change even after letting the default threadpool count.The interesting part is if I change await connection.OpenAsync() with connection.Open() the performance improves 10 times.1.01 seconds on an average of 100 concurrent calls. I tried playing around with connection pool settings and looks like even if I reduce it to an arbitrarily low number (2 is what tested with) the number doesn't change much.The driver code is:The reason I do a wait (by doing a .Result is because the driver code is a console app which has to have a sync main). In the actual production code everything including the controller is async.|,<c#><sql><ado.net><async-await>

POST URL's are always  I have used Set Active Session under HTTP session, before running the spider/active scanhave setup the context(though very few URL's appear under Sites), I have also tried to update structure parameter with words like "page", "UIDL" etc. which i could see in the URL'sI have also tried to exclude logout URL, but since all the POST URL's are the same, the spider and active scan don't really do anything, in that case.On right clicking i got an option to select the request as Form based Authentication. I have tried that as well, however, it populates the "Login Request POST data" with vaues like  12929ddf-5d7f-4264-b810-2fa8f38eca6f[["597","v","v",["pagelength",["i","28"]]],["597","v","v",["firstToBeRendered",["i","0"]]],["597","v","v",["lastToBeRendered",["i","26"]]],["597","v","v",["reqfirstrow",["i","15"]]],["597","v","v",["reqrows",["i","12"]]]]and fills the username/password fields with exactly the same.One last thing, do we really need to disable the XSRF to be able to use ZAP properly with Java/Vadin applications?I am simply trying to get it working and then continue learning from there.

MEF how to get non-shared instance references,|Recently, I encountered a problem when I use MEF in my WPF application. I created several classes like below. Part type was set to be CreationPolicy.NonShared so that there will be 2 different object imported to ClassA and ClassB.And I wrote a little piece of code to describe my problem below.So there will be ClassA, ClassB and a list of Part intances imported to Program object. Actually, what I wanted to get is all the Part intances that MEF container created. However, it comes a list with a brand new Part instance.I understand it may because of CreationPolicy.NonShared I specified to Part class. But even I try to find them in container.Catalog.Parts and I also found only one Part instance in it. It makes me confused. From my understanding, the container should hold all references of the objects it created since I already specified AllowRecomposition = true. I found an article to prove this. It says: Container and parts references  We believe that .Net Garbage Collector is the best thing to rely on for proper clean up. However, we also need to provider a container that has a deterministic behavior. Thus, the container will not hold references to parts it creates unless one of the following is true:   The part is marked as Shared The part implements IDisposable One or more imports is configured to allow recomposition   For those cases, a part reference is kept. Combined with the fact that you can have non shared parts and keep requesting those from the container then memory demand can quickly become an issue. In order to mitigate this issue you should rely on one of the following strategies discussed in the next two topics.So I have 2 questions:Why I cannot find more than one Part type instances in container?How can I get all exported Part instances in my demo?|,<.net><wpf><prism><mef>

Parsing JSON in Swift 3 like Apple's example for Swift 2,|I am working on parsing the JSON response from the Instagram API. The top-level object includes some metadata, and the entries I'm interested in are contained in an array object called "data".Apple's post here, uses Swift 2, and was published the day before Swift 3 was released (I believe). This post is very helpful, and has the same pattern that I am trying to use to get at the items I'm interested in as a dictionary. The JSON is structured very similarly.Here is the code:The compiler throws the error "Type '[String: Any]?' has no subscript members", on the line for case let items in json["data"] {. The variable json in the if let chain is given the type [String: Any]?. How can I avoid this, and structure the binding so that I get a dictionary typed [String: Any] in the json variable?Please note, I am not asking about how to parse JSON. I understand that. Apple's post is the exact pattern I would like to use, I would like to understand how to update the code in this post to Swift 3.UPDATE:Thanks to input from the comments below, I took a closer look at the types I was using. Because my JSON had a lot of arrays of dictionaries of arrays of dictionaries, I used this code to parse it:I could use a framework, but this helped me learn a bit more about parsing returned JSON that is heavily nested, not just simple flat values.|,<ios><json><swift><swift3>

|FOR loop should yield multiple results, but only yields one|,|I'm trying to pull very specific elements from a dictionary of RSS data that was fetched using the feedparser library, then place that data into a new dictionary so it can be called on later using Flask. The reason I'm doing this is because the original dictionary contains tons of metadata I don't need.

As it is below, it does create a dictionary object, but it's not comprehensive-- it only contains a single article's title, URL and description-- the rest is absent.

Plotting ROC curve for binary image,|I think ROC has some limitation to evaluate the performance of some binary classifier. I plot the ROC for an image classifier with this instruction: first I apply my detection method to the image, it's result is a gray-scale image. Now I must apply different threshold to obtain different binary images. For a range of threshold (for example th=0.01:0.01:1), I obtain a binary image corresponding to each threshold. Then for each binary image, true positive rate(TPR) and false positive rate(FPR) are calculated which (TPR,FPR) determines a point on the ROC curve. The whole curve includes the points that are calculated for each binary image. And my problem: if at the first step I have a binary image against a gray-scale image, how I can apply different threshold to it for plotting ROC. Is there any performance evaluation instead of ROC that be suitable for this state?|,<roc>

Self teaching python.

I'm more than happy to take criticism on everything from syntax to how to better comment. With that being said, let's get to my issue. This is a small guessing game. The book I'm reading taught the "for guessTaken" and subsequent code. My problem is in one small aspect of my code. The scoring system won't increment. I set up the code in the for loop called games then try to have it display at that start of each round and go up with each correct guess. However, it will display 0 for the first few rounds then it will show 2 ( or whatever your current score is I think...). I think the problem is I'm calling the score +1 int in an if statement but I've moved the code around and can't figure it out. I am aware that it's not beautiful! There are also a few bugs (number of games played isn't what you enter.)Right now I'm only working on the scoring system.|,<python><python-3.x>

How does du estimate file size?,|I am downloading a large file with wget, which I ran in the background with wget -bqc. I wanted to see how much of the file was downloaded so I randu -sh *in the directory. (I'd also be interested to know a better way to check wget progress in this case if anyone knows...) I saw that 25 GB had been downloaded, but for several attempts afterwards it showed the same result of 25 GB. I became worried that du had somehow interfered with the download until some time later when du showed a result of 33 GB and subsequently 40 GB.In searching stackoverflow and online, I didn't find whether it is safe to use du on files being written to but I did see that it is only an estimate that can be somewhat off. However, 7-8 GB seems like a lot, particularly because it is a single file, and not a directory tree, which it seems is what causes errors in the estimate.

Using Autofac to resolve multiple concrete classes of IRepository<T>?,|I'm new in AutoFac and I'm come across two problems that I need to implement in my WPF project using MVVM. I'm using an interface to implement a repository, but I'm going to implement multiple repositories for SQL, XML, and CSV. So my interface has this:So here's the rub: I was told by the boss that the customer needs to change repositories while still running the program. So I need to dynamically change the repository at run time. The default will be SQL Server, but the client may want to change to XML... WITHOUT losing the data that is already in the repository. The reason behind it is that if they load a configuration from SQL but they want to save it to a XML file and send it to their client, they can do so-- OR --They get an XML file from one of their clients, and they want to save the configuration to SQL, they can do so without worrying about re-entering the data.I solved one problem by using Generics because I'll be using the same POCO data model class and therefore it preserves the data but then:How do I implement the 3 different concrete repository classes?How do I pass in the parameter of T?I thought about using "named services" to differentiate between the concrete repository classes, and a model base class. I then would use a bootstrapper to look like this:Any suggestions?EDIT: I forgot to add in there that I'm using Dependency Injection on my ViewModels, so therefore, in my MainViewModel:now I did try as suggested that I change the code to this:I then debug the code by stepping into it, and when I hit at MainViewModel constructor, it's giving me XMLRepository class.

Localhost subdomains and wildcard issues,|I have setup on a xampp install a wildcard vhost on xampp in windows because I wanted to test some apps in localhost without having to add a too many lines to vhosts.conf for each and every app. I figured this would be the easiest and simplest way to do this was to add the following to my vhost.conf:This let's me access superawesomeapp1 at the foldername in htdocs as a subdomain of localhost. So anything in foo is at foo.localhost and bar to bar.localhost and so on.This worked well until I had an app that wanted the following added to vhost.conf:The vhost server alias overrides the latter, but I cannot figure out how to override the former short of commenting it out and manually mashing at the keys for every vhost I want to add which adds up after a while. I noticed it also overrode any attempt to redirect http to https. I might be running some of these things on localhost but I plan to use some of them over lan eventually.

Subscribe via webhook to a Facebook user's Activity Feed?,|I'd like to use the GraphAPI and Webhooks to subscribe to a user's activity feed and extract information such as metadata and stats about the shared posts they like. (Yes, I am well aware of the privacy concerns and this will be handled extremely carefully.)The closest question I could find is here:Extract Links from Facebook activity feedThe other answers are not relevant, as they either discuss the old FQL or plugins or are specific to Pages.I've been reading the GraphAPI documentation and the User Likes information only relates to the Pages they like (which doesn't change much). So this is a subset of the info needed - I need likes for Posts, not just Pages.What I am really interested in is the objects to which a given user has reacted. You can easily see the reactions for everyone to a given post with a GET /v2.8/{post-id}/reactions HTTP/1.1 call. But this is "reactions by post" and I need "reactions by user".The best solution I can figure out so far is to subscribe to their feed with a webhook and then collect a list of object IDs and then subscribe to their reactions for a certain period and filter by the user. This is not ideal or very efficient as it requires a fair number of subscriptions, and also only accounts for posts in the user's feed and not other posts they might have stumbled upon via some other means.So - how to extract all User Like info?|,<facebook><facebook-graph-api>

Creating a universal code,|I have been working on creating a universal equation to calculate the theta function. The current equation I have is not universal. This works for maximum of 2 thetas. If I have to do the calculation for theta more than 2, I have to manually modify the numbers within the brackets of theta(). Is there any way to setup a universal function? something like thata(j) = equation. I have pasted two codes below, one that is working but not universal and the other that I tried playing with and still ended up with error.Code 1:Code 2:The challenge with this code is that the when the code goes through the loop second time (i=1, j=2).

How to run ffmpeg command from the client side?,|I am trying to make an online examination portal. When students start the exam, their webcam will start automatically and record the stream live and store in the server. Invigilators will either watch the students live or they can watch the saved live streams later.After many research on various technologies I came across this link. It uses Node JS with websockets and ffmpeg. I ran the ffmpeg command and it streamed the live video successfully. But the problem is, in order to live stream, the students have to have ffmpeg installed in their system and they should run the command directly from the terminal. So how can I change this? The students will live stream from their browser, because this is a web portal. If we put this command in a PHP script, then the command will run at the server side. But client side command should run in this case. How can I run command from client side?Any suggestions will be helpful.|,<node.js><ffmpeg><live-streaming>
Limit camera only on a ground overlay? Google Map Android API v2,|I'm trying to show a ground overlay with markers on it to my users.

Make PHP run after form submitted without redirecting to another PHP page to process the data,|I'm not sure if this is a duplicate question due to the fact that I'm not even sure how to properly form it (That's why the title of this question makes no real sense). I am beginning to learn PHP so I can utilize SQL databases in my webpages.My question is, how would I be able to make it so a user types in a password into an input box, which is then used by a PHP script as the password to a MySQL login to display the contents of a table in an HTML table? Now, I have most of this figured out, the only problem is displaying the table on the same page which the password is entered and the submit button is hit. Would I need to use AJAX?

Access an image based on the array index value,|New to PHP and web-design and playing around with some image based PHP script.I have been looking around for a way to access a unique image value based on the current array value, but can't seem to find a way of doing it. All the examples I have found have listed the image in the initial array, and then called in in the foreach loop. Is it at all possible to access something without first declaring it in the array? Just trying to avoid double handling since the image(n).jpg will always match the indexed value. i.e. item1 = item1.jpg, item2=item2.jpg and so-on.Here is my code (I will note the invalid line):The incorrect line above is referencing an indexed item: that doesn't exist in the initial item1, item2 array.Is it possible to have the foreach loop create a link to an image based on the current index value? Or do I just add it to the original arrays each line.Assuming that the file is named correctly. Has a .jpg file extension, and in the same directory the output should look like:(Please note, I am not looking to rename any files uploaded, this is all assuming they have been uploaded correctly, in the correct format etc)Thanks all for the lengthy read!Edit:The counter idea is great for incremental increases, but is is possible to identify the image based on the array name/number? i.e. say the two arrays are completely different and non-sequential:This way it finds the dog56.jpg img and then the cat 72 img. (i.e. the img src is based on the array value)Kind RegardsBen S|,<php><arrays><indexing>

An OLE DB error has occurred. Error code: 0x80004005.There were errors during task validation. Error descriptionThe Excel spreadsheet loads fine on the desktop in SSIS. It has been deployed to run through the SSIS catalog on the server using Active Batch as the scheduler. On the Test environment this also works ok. The error only occurs when running the package from the Production server.Trouble shootingThe VS_ISBROKEN message normally indicates a metadata issue i.e. a column type has changed or a column is missing etc. To correct this you'd open up the the Data Flow task in SSIS reading from the affected spreadsheet and correct the issue or refresh the metadata. However when I do this in SSIS there are no errors reported, so nothing to fix or refresh.Ensured that my desktop, the Test server &amp; Production have the same driver version, same regional settings.Thought the date column might be treated differently on the Production server which is causing the metadata "VS_ISBROKEN" error. As above checked that the regional settings on the Production server is the same as my desktop and get no errors locally.Can't get SSIS installed on the Production to test it locally on the server.I have a similar package loading an Excel 2007 format successfully, which rules out an issue with the driver not working correctly.64bit is set to true as this is not using the Excel connection.Any suggestions to further troubleshoot the issue?|,<excel><ssis>

Smoothing out zoom with limits in Spritekit,|I've been working on adding zooming functionality to my project via an SKCameraNode and a pinch recognizer. My camera node is overlooking the mainMap node that contains my game and I would like to have limited zoom capability.In my function handler for pinches I have this code:I've looked at many somewhat similar questions but they don't have this exact issue. When the scale approaches the bound values and becomes values such as 1.09812164306641, I tend to have a stuttering effect on the zoom as it seems to not be able to get to the exact boundary value.Does anyone have advice on how to avoid this behavior? Most helpful would be an explanation of how to get the zoom to behave more naturally where on reaching a limit it does the little bounce effect customary to IOS applications. Really any coherent explanation on how to use cameras with smooth zooming would be much appreciated!Thank you|,<ios><sprite-kit><uipinchgesturerecognizer><skcameranode>

Google maps setZoom not working correctly,|I have a weird problem. I'm fetching data on my page and then updating my map with my new data.When the page first loads I initialize the map with initializeMap(). Then I load the data initializeMapData(). Subsequently, if I load the data after the initial page load (with ajax) I don't re-initialize the map, I just call initializeMapData().The problem is sometimes the zoom in the map doesn't reflect the value I provide, although I'm printing out the zoom level via getZoom(), and it shows the correct value, it's not correct on the map. It looks like it doesn't update it (so it's the previous map zoom level), even though the getZoom shows the correct value.FYI -- If I initialize the map intitializeMap() each time I fetch data via ajax and update that data it works, but then I see the map flicker from the re-initialize, which I don't want. I'm just trying to avoid this and feel like it should work!Here are two main methods. The first and second method will always get called on page load, and only the second method gets called on an ajax call to update the data in the map.UPDATED! -- I found the area that's causing the issue. IT's clearing the listener for the zoom changed event! But if I remove clearing it, then the event gets created and called multiple times every time update the data. Not good!

Best practices regarding Flask CRUD Views,|I am currently working on a CRUD application that will end up spanning a rather large database and I would like to go about it using best practices.When I design a Flask View I currently put all functions in one view like this.As you can imagine this view can become rather large when taking all the db functionality into consideration (relationships, selectfield choice generation, multi-tenancy controls etc.).Another way to accomplish this same task would be to build five views like this.The downside here of course is that I would need to put in a lot of repetitive code.Is either method considered "best practice" and if not, is there a third option?|,<python><view><flask><crud>

Is it possible to authenticate the user for applications on multiple domains or IP addresses with CAS server?,|My environment is Spring4, and using Spring-security also.For example, there are two servers contain the same type Java applications, powered by Jetty application server.

Would you please suggest simply the architecture ?EDITI tested this environment with Spring4 + Spring-security + Spring-cas according to the document, 21. CAS AuthenticationHowever, the session cookie provider is Spring instead of CAS, therefore sessions were created for each servers' IP addresses. If we had serverA's session after logged-in that, it's impossible to obtain serverB's session. I failed to reduce login attempts. I mean anyway it's necessary to input ID/Pass to login serverA &amp; serverB each other.After it took a long time, I realized my real requirement that it's possible to login multiple resources ( over server resources ) with one-time login attempt. However, I think it's extended meaning of "single-sign on"...in passingSpring-session project provides the architecture to share sessions for multiple resources. Spring-session stores their sessions on Redis back-end.However, it's also difficult to use Spring-session, because it requires domains like a.example.com or b.example.com instead of IP addresses.|,<java><cas>

Static Class Persistance in MVC Applications,|I have over the last couple of months migrated my Webforms knowledge to MVC knowledge, and I have to say that after originally being an MVC skeptic I am loving MVC and the way it works.The only thing I am still a bit unclear about is how static classes are persisted in MVC. In Webforms static class values were shared amongst the different clients accessing the application, which could lead to a user overwriting another users values should you decide to use static classes to save user related variables. My first question is whether or not this is still the case in MVC?Then my second question is about where to keep the DBContext instance in my MVC application. Currently I have it as a public variable in a static DAL class. The single context is then shared amongst all the clients. The more I read about this the more I am starting to believe that this is the incorrect approach, but recreating the context inside each controller seems repetitive. Is there a downside to having the Context in a static class?|,<c#><asp.net-mvc><entity-framework>

Protect Private Data in Amazon S3,|I want to upload some images on Amazon S3 and based on the user's subscription give them the access of viewing some portions of these images. After reading Amazon S3 documentation I have come up with these solutions:Assigning each user in my application to one IAM user in Amazon S3 and then defining user policy or bucket policy to manage who has access to what. But there is two drawbacks: First, the user or bucket policies have limit on their size and since the number of users and images are very large it is very likely that I need to exceed that limit. Second, the number of IAM users per AWS account is bounded to 5000 and I would have more users in my application. Amazon S3 makes it possible to define some temporary security credentials that act the same as IAM users. It's possible for me to require the client side to make a request to my server and I create a temporary IAM user for them with a special policy and pass them their credentials then they can directly send request to S3 using their credentials and have access to their resources. But the problem is that these users would last between 15 min to 1 hour and therefore the clients need to request my server at least every 1 hour to make a temporary IAM user for them. Since I want to serve some images it is a good practice to use combination of Amazon Cloudfront and S3 to serve the content as quick as possible. I have also read the Cloudfront documentation for serving private content and I found out that their solution is using signed URLs or signed cookies. I will deny any access to S3 resources and the cloudfront would be the only one who has the access to read data from S3 and every time a user signs in to my application I would send them the credentials that they need to have to make a signed URL or I would send them the necessary cookies. They can request required resources with the information that they have and this information would last until they are signed in to my application. But I have some security concerns. Since almost all of the information about access control is sent to the client (e.g. in cookies) they can easily modify it and grant themselves more permissions. However it is a big concern but I think I have to use cloudfront for decreasing loading resource time. I want to know you think which of these solutions is more reasonable and better than others and also if there are other solutions maybe using other Amazon web services. |,<amazon-web-services><amazon-s3><private><amazon-cloudfront>

Rxjava2 + Retrofit2 + Android. Best way to do hundreds of network calls,|I have an app. I have a big button that allows the user to sync all their data at once to the cloud. A re-sync feature that allows them to send all their data again. (300+ entries) I am using RXjava2 and retrofit2. I have my unit test working with a single call. However I need to make N network calls. What I want to avoid is having the observable call the next item in a queue. I am at the point where I need to implement my runnable. I have seen a bit about Maps but I have not seen anyone use it as a queue. Also I want to avoid having one item fail and it report back as ALL items fail, like the Zip feature would do. Should I just do the nasty manager class that keeps track of a queue? Or is there a cleaner way to send several hundred items?NOTE: SOLUTION CANNOT DEPEND ON JAVA8 / LAMBDAS. That has proved to be way more work than is justified.Note all items are the same object.My helper to gather and send all my items my Retrofit stuffUpdate. I have been trying to apply this answer to not much luck. I am running out of steam for tonight. I am trying to implement this as a unit test, like I did for the original call for one item..

Even after setting up the path on my mac, javahome to point to 1.8, etc. I could not get it to work. If this was a newer project I would push harder. However as this is an inherited android application written by web developers trying android, it is just not a great option. Nor is it worth the time sink to get it working.

Approximate missing value for input given a data set,|I have a data set with x attributes and y records.

I'm looking for a solution which uses regression to determine the missing value and ideally makes use of a model which is built once (if possible, to not have to generate one each time).|,<machine-learning><classification><regression><imputation>
Implement filters with counters,|What I want to achieve: I am developing website with a catalog of products.This is normalized model (simplified) of entities which are related to my question:So some product features exist (like size and type in this example), which all have predefined sets of values (e.g. sizes 1, 2 and 3 exist, and type may be 1, 2 or 3 (these sets do not have to be equal, just example.)).Relationship between Product and each of features is "many-to-many" - different values of one feature do not exclude each other.My task is to build form which will allow user to filter search results, based on features of products. Example screenshot:Multiple checked values of one feature are mixed using "AND" logic, so if I have sizes One and Three checked, I need all products, which have both sizes (+ may have any other sizes, that doesn't matter, but selected ones must be present). Number near each value of feature represents amount of products, which is returned if user checks this value right now. So it is effectively a number of products satisfying filter "current active filter + this one value applied".When user checks/unchecks any value, counters must be updated considering new "current filter".Problem:Real use case is: ~200k products, ~6 features with ~5-15 values each.My COUNT queries, (especially with decent number of selected options) are too slow, and to render the form I need as many of these counts as there are values of all filters - in total that gives unacceptable response time.What I have tried:Query to retrieve results:(this is to select products which have sizes 1, 2, 3 and 5 at the same time).It completes in ~0.360 sec on 120k products, almost same time with COUNT wrapped around it. And this query does not allow more than one feature (but I could place values of all features in one table).Another query to retrieve the same set:It completes in ~0.230 sec (same time when wrapped in COUNT) and does not allow multiple features too.It is modified query I found here: https://www.simple-talk.com/sql/t-sql-programming/divided-we-stand-the-sql-of-relational-division/ (second query in "Division with a Remainder" part).Alternative schema:Denormalized model, where value of each feature is a boolean column in Products table.The query is obvious here:Weird and harder to maintain in application's code, but completes in ~0.056 sec when COUNT-ing.None of these methods are acceptable per se because multiplied ~30 times (to populate all counters in form) that gives inadequate response time.Caching and precomputingData in DB is going to be updated only few times a day (like, may be, even 2), so I could probably precompute counts for all combinations of filters when data is updated (I haven't measured necessary time to be honest), but it is anyway not going to work too - search form has fields with arbitrary values (like min/max price and text search by the product's name), which I can't precompute for.Load counters in form dynamicallyRender form, but fetch numbers through AJAX, so user would be able to see page, and then, after quite long waiting, numbers. This is my last thought, but it seems like poor quality of service for me (may be it is worse than no counters at all).I am stuck. Any hints? May be I am not seeing some bigger picture? I would be very glad to any advice.UPDATE: if we forget about counters, what is the effective and usually used way (query) for just retrieving results with such a filters (or what am I doing wrong)? Like "find post with all requested tags" model, that is equivalent. I suspect it can be faster than my 0.230 sec (query #2), considering small (?) amount of rows for MySQL.|,<mysql><sql>

But I used Vector3d(1, 2, 3) in most of my tests, so when it ran into ortho test, it still worked because largestAbsIndex = 2, indexNextToLargest = 1 -- just lucky. However, Vector3d(1, 4, 3).ortho will crash because largestAbsIndex = 1, indexNextToLargest = 0 and Vector3d(value: 1, at: 0) == nilI observed this bug and it's obvious how to fix it. But TDD suggests that I should first write a test that reveals this bug and then fix the production code. On the other hand, one says that test cases should test behaviors not implementations, so I don't have enough excuse to add a new test of Vector3d(1, 4, 3).ortho because it is the concrete implementation details that made these two tests differ.So, what test should I add to reveal this bug?This problem arises because the ortho getter is doing something not related to it's expected behavior and of course that irrelevant behaviors didn't get tested. I may extract those (i.e. largestAbsIndex, indexNextToLargest) to some other methods and then test them respectively. But there are still problems. These methods of course should be private, whereas I can't and shouldn't test private methods. One says I can extract those methods to another class and test that class if there is an inevitable need for testing private methods. I may extract a enum or something like Vector3dComponentIndex. But I still can't stand something like that is being public around, because it's meaningful only when used within Vector3dIn either approach (extract to private methods or extract to a class/struct/enum that should be private), there is a problem that how to increase the test coverage in private codes?|,<swift><tdd>

Generics inheritance and Swift compiler,|Here's an interesting challenge...For some job reasons I'm trying to automatise the management of all UITableView objects we code in the office. The thing is that when you have an application with lots of UITableView objects, you'll constantly repeat the same data-sourcing pattern: numberOfRowInSection, cellForRowAtIndexPath, and so on...I've been thinking about this, and I've found a way to automatise all this repeating data-sourcing pattern: generics inheritance.Code is too long to post here, so I've created a GitHub repo here.You'll find a Playground demonstrating how the concept works, under the Concept folder. Under the Framework folder you'll find a non-working approach to transform the Playground concept to a Swift Framework. By now it seems to be a Swift compiler bug that makes it not work. Here's what the command line compiler throws while trying to compile the Framework:It's pretty strange because the same code works under a Playground but does not compile under a standard Xcode project...Can anyone contribute?|,<swift><generics>

|javascript language with node, npm, bowe, corejs, babel, what is that? i am newbie|,|I am new to programming. I've learnt html and javascript for beginner. Then I tried to level up and gotten trouble in javascript.

Another trouble, I tried to open sweep.js and read the "mixed" code. then I know "Asynchronous" and "Synchronous" code. All this while, I learnt javascript with sync code and I've understand it. I can analyze the code, explain procedure, and etc. But now, with async such as nodejs, npm, babel and etc it's hard for me to understand the code. All the codes are similar with jquery. The variable name, function name and they're emphasizing using alphabet not English word. Okay, it can be renamed but it's about structure....Even there are main code I can understand it starting with numbering first and function like above. What is that?

Or refer to either the warps that can read momory for datar or warps that are ready to be processed by SPs,which means that the rest warps except those 64 can neither read memory nor be processed by SPs untill some of those 64 resident warps are done. |,<cuda><gpu><gpu-warp><warp-scheduler>

Prevent shared session between tabs or same browser windows,|I have to fix this basic web application that allows viewing data, say customers data, and editing it using Tomcat and Spring framework. My problem happens when I try editing different customers data from different browser tabs at the same time; the edited data gets mixed. If I open customer A to be edited in one tab, I open customer B in another tab, then I go back editing customer A and save it, this last changes for customer A are applied to customer B. Investigating a bit this problem happens because the customer data is stored in the session, but this session is shared between the different tabs. So when I open customer A in one tab, this customer is stored in the session but when I open customer B in another tab, this latest is the one stored. Thus, when I finish editing customer A and I submit the form, the changes are applied to the customer found in the session, customer B.I see here different solutions to my problem. One solution would be preventing users from opening our application in multiple tabs, but it gets too complicated and I feel it's dirty. The other solution would be to simply using different sessions for the different tabs, but I am not sure how can I achieve this. Reading this forum I found another post that mentions using setting in the context.xml file of the Tomcat 'cookies=false' but then the whole application fails and I don't want to touch more than necessary in a code that is not mine. Also I see it is mentioned to use HTML5 SessionStorage, but I could not find any good example implementing this.I think this must be a common problem, shared session between tabs, and that it must have a common solution. What solution would be suitable in this case? EDIT:Let's say I have this code:I am not sure what does the modelMap.put("customer", customer); but I assume is where the customer is stored in the session. I can successfully add a hidden field in the jsp page and retrieve the Customer from the database in the save method by adding @RequestParam(value = "customerId", required = true) Long customerId, now my question is, the Customer I get in the save method with @ModelAttribute("customer") Customer customer is the customer submitted from the jsp or the one stored in the session? And furthermore, if this is the one stored in the session, how do I retrieve the changed made in the jsp?|,<java><spring><jsp><tomcat><servlets>

Maven dependency resolving in multi module project,|I have a question about how the Maven dependency resolving mechanism is working in a multi module project.Normally I only use 'mvn clean install' when I build my multi module projects and my assumption was that if any module in the project needs a previous module, dependency will be resolved by going local repository and loading the corresponding 'jar'.For project internal reason, I have to use 'mvn clean compile,' this command naturally does not create any 'jar' while 'install' is not there. So here I started wondering, how the dependency resolution for a multi module project works, while jar' is not created but project still able to see the changes from the previous builds.

How to structure cache storage / cache clearing in a massive monolithic web app?,|We are developping an application that, for many reasons, is based on a aging code base. It is actively used by customers, and keeps evolving.We recently came accross performance problems, which we chose to solve by adding caches. Lists, Menus, big Graphs, they are all stored as some sort of cache (separate files on the file system)For each cache you basically have two processes:a cache creation process (or update) a cache deletion/refreshing processSince the application is monolithic, the possible actions that cause a cache saving or clearing are not obvious and self-explaining. There are many entry points that could trigger such a process (build a new menu? clear the menu cache - and so forth).So we sometimes have the problem that a very minor part of the app is not clearing the cache, for example. Or another one is not refreshing the cache when it should.Basically, we lack overview of all cache clearing/saving triggers.Two questions:how can I accurately model such an overview?how should I technically organize the triggers which clear or save caches ? |,<php><caching><web><architecture>

Play 2.5 upgrade error: CompletionException - There is no HTTP Context available from here,|After upgrading from Play 2.4 to Play 2.5 on a sample app, when I run ./activator clean dist, I get no errors however after going to a specific endpoint http://localhost:9000/java/proxy, I'm receiving the following error: I have been using the guide from the Replaced F.Promise with Java 8's CompletionStage replacing F.Promise, map, and flatMap with the suggested replacements from the previous link (reflected snippet of changes below).When going back to 2.4, I don't get this error and the http://localhost:9000/java/proxy endpoint works successfully.

Force ffmpeg to exit with error code whenever thumbnail isn't successfully created,|To get a thumbnail from an image at 100 seconds I can do ffmpeg -ss 100 -i /tmp/video.mp4 -frames:v 1 -s 200x100 image.jpg. However, if the video is less than 100 seconds, ffmpeg doesn't create a thumbnail but also doesn't exit with any error code, which is quite unexpected.The command exits with no error code (exit status of 0). It only outputs a message on stderr saying Output file is empty, nothing was encoded (check -ss / -t / -frames parameters if used).I would like ffmpeg to exit with an error code under any situation where a thumbnail hasn't been created. Otherwise I'll always have to do another check from my application code after the ffmpeg command to ensure that the expected number of thumbnails has been output to the filesystem.Is there a way around having to do this application-level check, and force ffmpeg to fail whenever it doesn't successfully write a thumbnail to the filesystem?|,<image><video><image-processing><ffmpeg><thumbnails>

Electron global shortcut to toggle show/hide of menubar,|I am trying to add a global shortcut to my Electron app that will toggle showing/hiding it. My app is a menubar app built using maxogden/menubar and React.I have the following code. I've left a couple of bits out just for brevity but this is how I have setup the global shortcuts.I think it's important to note one of the tips on the maxogden/menubar Readme too: Use mb.on('after-create-window', callback) to run things after your app has loadedOnce the menubar has first been opened, my shortcut is registered and will work to show the app. However, the code I've implemented to unregister the shortcut, and re-register it to hide the app (when showing), doesn't seem to work.I'm not sure if my code to reregister the shortcut is setup within the right event handler i.e after-show and focus-lost. I have a feeling that these event handlers I'm working within are related directly to my menu rather than menu.window. This would explain why the reregistration of the shortcut isn't happening, but I'm not sure.Does anyone have any idea how I would sensibly set up a global shortcut toggle to open/close my menubar app?|,<javascript><reactjs><keyboard-shortcuts><electron><menubar>

That is, the figure was the grand total for the line across all periods and sites:Referring to join keys in fact table:ALLEXCEPT('vw_PandL','vw_PandL'[PeriodCode],'vw_PandL'[SiteKey]) Referring to join keys in dimensions:ALLEXCEPT('vw_PandL','vw_DimPeriod'[PeriodCode],'DimSite'[SiteKey])The only way I could get the calc to honour my slicers was to use the actual field that I was physically using in my slicer, in other words the labelThe key thing to learn from this is this is not just a relational database where you join on a key then filtering on the label will work.

|how are @types, typescript and webpack related|,|To use an exported type in .ts file one has to add import itNow when I use this I do not get intellisense, I still need to do npm install @types\jQuery to get that.So without @types, above statement just infers that during typescript bundling include this file.

Proper way to fillout a communication packet in java?,|I need to send and receive data from an android device (in other words, I'm coding in java) to another C based program.

C++ Trie Core Dumped Segmentation Fault,|I was solving the following question from Facebook Hacker Cup: Since you crave state-of-the-art technology, you've just purchased a phone with a great new feature: autocomplete! Your phone's version of autocomplete has some pros and cons. On the one hand, it's very cautious. It only autocompletes a word when it knows exactly what you're trying to write. On the other hand, you have to teach it every word you want to use.  You have N distinct words that you'd like to send in a text message in order. Before sending each word, you add it to your phone's dictionary. Then, you write the smallest non-empty prefix of the word necessary for your phone to autocomplete the word. This prefix must either be the whole word, or a prefix which is not a prefix of any other word yet in the dictionary.  What's the minimum number of letters you must type to send all N words?I am implementing a trie for this as follows:However I seem to be getting Segmentation fault(Core Dumped) error which I understand means that I am accessing an invalid memory location however I cannot seem to figure out where it is the case in my code.

How can multiple threads invoke one same service thread?,|The questionThe software runs on one DELL server with Linux. Language could be C++, JAVA or Python.Both thread A and thread B assign tasks to the service thread. When receiving tasks, service thread will put the tasks on its own task queue. When thread is free, it will execute the tasks and return task results to thread A or thread B depending on who sent request.Thread A has a higher priority than thread B.My thoughtsIt is very similar to server/client in socket programming. However, since this software runs on one same server, TCPIP does not seem a good solution to me.Another thought is to use a common database for this, such as redis. But Redis runs also on TCPIP and I am not sure if this could be a good fit.Someone also suggests using a service DLL and both Thread A and Thread B can invoke service DLL directly. However I do not have experiences building DLL simultaneously serving several threads. Is this possible? My question is: how to achieve this in a suitable way?|,<java><c++><multithreading><server>

|AngularJS Double HTTP requests, is this a good solution or am i doing something wrong?|,|The StructureI have two controllers and one model. a order controller which handles one step of the order processa order nav controller which handles only the navigation of the ordera order model which handles all data of the order.All information is stored in the order object, depending on which bundle you choose you receive a tab ment to configure that bundle.While navigating through different steps of the order the nav controller is always there doing its job and the order controller could change in different controllers necessary for the certain configure step your currently at.The scenarioWhen loading the first state the order controller is initializing and the nav controller is initializing. Both calling the "OrderModel.getOrder()" method, which is a promise with a http call.If both controller are initializing and the promise is not resolved yet it causes double request to the api, which i think is a little bit overkill.The solutionI created a wrapper around the $q library, which adds a new method, unique.The unique method is storing the promise into the model, if the promise does not exists yet it creates a new promise, else it returns the promise which is not resolved yet.

Adding a class and ID to headers using Javascript,|The way that Zendesk's Help Centre works is by printing all the sections onto the page without giving them any unique identifier, so it's a pain if you want to implement any sort of scrollspy (updating a sidenav with where you are on the page), and most importantly anchors so that the sidenav actually works.I'm not that technical and was wondering if anyone knew of a way to add an ID &amp; class to a series of headers using JS?I'm thinking for each h2 in section-tree-with-article, adding a unique ID, and a class that matches the h2's text?Any thoughts?|,<javascript><class><zendesk>

How to federate to multiple different (private) ADFS in ASP.NET SaaS app,|We're trying to implement identity federation using ASP.NET 4.6.2 and OWIN/Katana.Our scenario is that we have a single web site running on our infrastructure, and we have a small number of tenants (10-20).When a user needs to login, they browse to the app's URL and have their tenant id as a subdomain:Each tenant has an ADFS server, which is not (and cannot be made) accessible by our infrastructure directly.The idea is that we redirect the user's browser to their proper ADFS server, which will work because the user can in reach it. Authentication will be done according to the ws-federation protocol.So our problem consists of 2 parts:How can we redirect the user to their company's ADFS serverHow can we validate each ADFS server's tokenNote: I'm only looking for pointers, I'm not expecting a full implementation or anything.The specific question really is, what parts of the WsFederationAuthenticationMiddleware can we hook into, to dynamically alter the request parameters and token validation mechanisms?|,<asp.net><owin><claims-based-identity><katana><ws-federation>

VS2015 Pre-Build Event - Cannot automatically update source file,I am working on a fairly large C++ application using a VS2015 solution comprising of multiple projects.

The problem I'm having is that the pre-build event takes place but VS does not include the new file in the build until I press build a second time.

UIView not displaying,|I am trying to create a simple UIView by calling the following function:I do not get any errors, however the UIView doesn't seem to appear. The text "Test" is printed to the console which tells me it's not a function calling problem. Another thing to note is that I use the exact same code in a different function at a different part of my program to create a different UIView and that code works perfectly. I have absolutely no idea why this code isn't working. At first I thought it may be a zPosition issue, but after experimenting with the zPosition I see no difference.I then thought it may have something to do with there already being other UIViews being displayed at the time of calling the function, and the new one that the function "should" be creating isn't getting displayed because the program is thinking "It's ok, you already have a UIView here sir! No need to display another!", as strange as that may be.Update:I am calling the loadCell function inside of another function called drawGrid(). drawGrid() is simple a nested for loop which creates a grid of UIViews x along and y high. The drawGrid() function works perfectly when spawning in level 1, however once level 1 is complete and I try to spawn in level 2 that is when it doesn't spawn the next set of UIViews. It prints all of my print("Test")s to the console multiple times which tells me it IS getting to that point in the program but doesn't want to create the next grid of UIViews. Update 2:As you can see, the functions I posted here at the beginning are a little different as I removed unnecessary, irrelevant code not to get confused by. I have added it all back here, and if there is anything you are unsure about just ask :) I also added the "BreakGrid()" function with deletes/removes the previous grid of UIViews. and after deleted I run the drawGrid() again for the next level.|,<swift><xcode><uiview><swift3>

Maven commons-io information does not match signer information,|i am facing a possible conflict in my project with the commons-io on which some of my dependency depend.

Below is the output. Note: The Web Application module has a dependency on the Core module, while the Core module has a dependency on ESB common module1) My first step was to exclude from all the ESB common dependencies the commons-io , which is not used anyway in this module. Then i included the core module the commons-io 2.4 as provided (using Wildlfly 10). That did not fix the problem.2) Second try was to add the following in my parent pom.xmlWith that change i was unable to deploy the application, while i was getting the following exception Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils3) I tried in the dependencyManagement as shown in (2) to add type: pom and scope: import.

Visual Studio publishing files with older dates (not up to date),|I encounter a strange behaviour with an ASP.NET project's deployment.When I publish it, it does copy files into the publish directory.But it publishes OLD versions of some of the files (files date is 1 week ago)!The same happens if I delete the concerned files before hitting the publish button.I am using the "files system" publish mode.As a matter of fact, when I start the project in release mode, the old code is being used.Even stranger, I have noticed that if I run this sequence:clean solutionregenerate solutionpublish the web project (part of this solution) causing the old version problem --> so files are being deployed with wrond dates as explinedclear web cache to be surestart the project in release mode Then the old code is being executed as described.Now If I do this way:clean solutionregenerate solutionpublish the web project (part of this solution) causing the old version problem --> so files are being deployed with wrond dates as explinedclear web cache to be surestart the project in release mode : old code is being executedstop the execution- start the project in debug mode  -> the up to date files are being used as it does not use the deploy folder at allstop debug executionstart the project in release mode again:then the new code is being executed!!!As if having run the project in debug mode forced the files to use the up to date version.And even even stranger, at this stage, although VS seems to use the correct versions, the files dates is still wrong which lets me suspect that the concerned files are still not up to date....I am completely puzzled!!|,<asp.net><visual-studio><publishing>

how to use usb trigger for cash drawer in website programmer,|I have a question, how to open cash drawer using USB trigger for cash drawer (BT-100U). Does anyone have advice how to use it in website?Its is the description fro the product.Description : BT-100U Cash Drawer Driver Trigger With USB Interface BT-100U cash drawer trigger is designed to provide USB interfacing to the cash drawer. This allows the cash drawer- which is previously connected to POS printer or cash register- to be directly connected to a USB port of the computer. This means through the USB Trigger the cash drawer can be directly connected to the computer when this no printer used in the POS system. The BT-100U USB trigger module uses a virtual serial port driver- making it appear to software like a standard RS232 serial port. This way existing POS software can communicate with the USB cash drawer trigger as though connected to a serial port. A unique serial number is assigned to each USB trigger module and driver software will assign the next available serial port to each device it recognizes(multiple triggers can be used on one computer). Cash drawer can be directly connected to the computer with BT-100U Powered by USB bus- external power is not required Allows for "Hot Plugging"- plug and play connectivity No need to set the COM property Suitable to any cash drawer command.please explain to me with example code. Thank you.|,<javascript><php><usb>

How to get a developer key for ViaGogo API,|Long shot, but I'd like to fiddle with ViaGogo API (C# library more precisely). ViaGogo has a well documented public API, documentation is avaliable here.

Furthermore, there's no field to leave an e-mail address.Their C# library seems pretty popular as far as I can tell from downloads from NuGet; I wonder how all these thousands of devs succesfully called that API.Has anyone succesfully obtained authentication info from ViaGogo?|,<c#><viagogo-api>

Nopcommerce Update entity issue,|Using NopCommerce 3.8, Visual Studio 2015 proff.I have created a plugin that is responsible for making restful calls to my Web API that exposes a different DB to that of Nop.The process is run via a nop Task, it successfully pulls the data back and i can step through and manipulate as i see fit, no issues so far.Issue comes when i try to update a record on the product table, i perform the update... but nothing happens no change, no error.I believe this is due to the Context having no idea about my newly instantiated product object, however I'm drawing a blank on what i need to do in relation to my particular example.Similar questions usually reference a "model" object that is part of the parameter of the method call, "model" has the method ToEntity which seems to be the answer in similar question in stack.However my example doesn't have the ToEntity class/method possibly because my parameter is actually a list of products. To Clarify here my code.Method in RestClient.csMethod in my Service ClassThen the method to bind and updateSo as you can see, I get the data and pass data through to certain method based on a result. From that list in the method I iterate over, and pull the the entity from the table, then update via the product service using that manipulated entity.So what am I missing here, I'm sure its 1 step, and i think it may be either be because 1) The context still has no idea about the entity in question, or 2) Its Incorrect calls.SummaryUpdate is not updating, possibly due to context having no knowledge OR my methodology is wrong. (probably both).UPDATE:I added some logger.inertlog all around my service, it runs through fine, all to the point of the call of update. But again I check the product and nothing has changed in the admin section.pluginI have provided the full source as i think maybe this has something to do with the rest of the code setup possibly?UPDATE:Added the following for testin on my execute method.This successfully updates the product description.

Show username after posting (php/mysql),|I am working on a small community page where users will be able to post news, pictures, and comment on them.

I am working with multiple tables here, one that stores the user info, and some that store the entry info (news, comments, pictures). Now whenever a user posts something, I want to get his user ID out of the table USER, so that I can INSERT a new line INTO my table (in this case) NEWS, which wants the values Text, Title and U_ID as foreign key. I am working with sessions, and since I had no problem simply displaying the name of the login user, I tried to use that user to select "his" row from the table and put the result into a variable ($uid) which I was hoping to use in another query for the INSERT INTO.

So far it works well, and all requests to server A are forwarded successfully to server B.After that I configured WebLogic on server B for 2-way SSL. This time when a request is sent to IIS, IIS returns HTTP 502 (Bad Gateway). If I send the request directly to server B, it will work fine.Is this a limitation of IIS whereby it cannot forward request to a server configured with 2-way SSL?Thanks in advance.|,<ssl><iis-7.5><reverse-proxy>
Toolbar overflow does not resize when hiding button labels,|RequirementA WPF toolbar which, as it becomes smaller, hides the button labels. If the labels are hidden and buttons still don't fit, they move to the overflow.IssueWhen I start with a full-size window and shrink it, everything works fine.However, when I start with a small window, the toolbar buttons are in the overflow, the labels are hidden however the button size is as if the label was visible. I am using Collapsed for label visibility.What I tried so farUse a bound property for label visibilityThat fixes the issue in the overflow however, as the window increases in size, the issue appears for the buttons visible on the toolbar. Once I reach the size where everything fits with the labels visible, it works fine. I can shrink it back and it behaves correctly.Explicitly set alignment and auto width for all elementsI thought maybe the default for some elements involved is not to resize automatically.

|getaddrinfo, AI_PASSIVE - different behaviour windows <-> linux|,|I have adapted the code from  (selectserver.c -- a cheezy multiperson chat server) to compile on Windows. The complete code follows below. I compile using gcc version 6.1.0 (x86_64-posix-seh, Built by MinGW-W64 project). I compile using gcc6.1.0 on Linux, too. Basically, you run it, telnet 2 or more times to port 9034, and whatever you type in one telnet session gets echoed to the other telnet sessions (depending on the system, one has to type Enter before it gets echoed - on Windows it echoes every character typed).Now the problem : On Linux AMD64 or ARM, I can connect to it from localhost and from another system, be that Windoes or Linux. On Windows, it only works on localhost, and I fail to understand why. The fact that hints.ai_flags = AI_PASSIVE; is specified makes it listen on all interfaces, if I understand things correctly.The MSDN doc states: Setting the AI_PASSIVE flag indicates the caller intends to use the returned socket address structure in a call to the bind function.   When the AI_PASSIVE flag is set and pNodeName is a NULL pointer, the IP address portion of the socket address structure is set to INADDR_ANY for IPv4 addresses and IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT for IPv6 addresses.The code reads : How do I make this behave correctly on Windows?

Missing dSYM files in Crashlytics Today extension (Bitcode disabled),|The title of this question basically says it all. I enabled Crashlytics in my Today extension, and for some reasons, the dSYMs are not being uploaded, even though I'm not using Bitcode.I tried uploading them manually (from ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Derived Data/Timelines-evxmjnxmpmcivkavmpijzakaxkrp/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/Timelines.app.dSYM), but the web interface doesn't really give me any feedback. It shows this screen: No matter how long I wait, once I refresh the page, it goes back to the 'upload dSYMS' screen.I think the problem might be that the UUIDs of the missing dSYMs don't really match those that I found locally.

I'm just testing it locally on my devices.

Creating IOS app only using the command line of cordova,|Which is not considered in IOS Platform Guide of Cordova. According to it, there should be some flags provided in order to create IOS app using command line.

Only using the flags --developmentTeam and --codeSignIdentityThe documentation states: This is new for Xcode 8. The development team (Team ID) to use for code signing. You would use this setting and a simplified Code Sign Identity (i.e. just 'iPhone Developer') to sign your apps, you do not need to provide a Provisioning Profile.So, we have developmentTeam flag which is actually our TeamID that we can see in our Apple account. But in this case, it is unclear how to define codeSignIdentity without messing with XCode.2. Using ProvisioningProfileSecond manner is by creating provisioning profile and by using its GUID. Again, it is not explained in cordova documentation and in apple documentation without using XCode.So, the question is: is it not possible to create (debug or release) IOS app without using XCode?

CUR_COMMIT in DB2 for z/OS,|My question is about DB2 for z/OS ver. 10 in an environment with possible concurrent requests under heavy load.As far as I understood from the CUR_COMMIT=ON DB2 configuration option effect is that SELECT queries in DB2/zOS are not blocked in the presence of related (regarding the same tables) uncommitted DELETE/INSERT statements, but blocks SELECT queries on related uncommitted UPDATEs (contrary to DB2 LUW where SELECTs are not blocked also in the case of an uncommitted UPDATEs - as I verified myself on the DB2 express version) and return immediately the currently committed data if there is no blocking.Thus, as the article suggests, it should still be possible (on DB2 for z/OS with CUR_COMMIT=ON) to read the currently committed data without waiting for related SQL statements which modify data to be committed, if the application uses only DELETE/INSERT statements to modify data (so that it uses DELETE/INSERT statements instead of UPDATE statements).I have little experience on mainframes and DB2, so I wanted to ask if this is really the case, i.e. does indeed using only DELETE/INSERT statements guarantee that none of my SELECTs get blocked until related DELETE/INSERT statements are committed? Would using only DELETE/INSERT statements be a thinkable (i.e. "not a very bad practice" from the performance point of view in a heavy load environment) solution also in the case of large tables on DB2 for z/OS (millions of rows)?|,<database><concurrency><db2><isolation-level><db2-zos>

Who Fixed The Sonar Issue,|We have a SonarQube 6.0 server with enabled SCM plug-in. So the REST webservice returns the author for each new issue. While this is an important information, the person who fixed the issue is also important to me. The assignee seems to be that person, however the issues are auto-assigned to whoever created them and their assignee doesn't get changed when somebody else commits a fix. (And yes, the author should fix the issues, but often they don't.)Things I tried: Rerun Sonar on a project that was not changed since the SCM plug-in was introduced: the author was filled with the committer, and the assignee was only filled if there is currently a Sonar user with the same nameintroduced a new issue - both the assignee and the committer where set to the committerfixed an issue with an assignee: nothing changedfixed an issue without an assignee: nothing changed So from that I assume if I wanted to fix an issue, I had to manually open the Sonar Website, find the project, find the issue, assign it to me, than commit. That's not really acceptable. So I assume there is some other way for Sonar to handle that information.How do I find out who fixed a Sonar issue?|,<sonarqube>

How to create skeletal robot arm with Newton Game Dynamics Engine in GLScene,|I'd like to implement a skeletal robot arm with GLScene, in GLScene there is a component such as TGLNGD, which provides the physics interaction of objects in scene, based on newtondynamics.

Stable sort dynamically created array which contains duplicates (javascript),|I've been working on this for a couple of days, looked through all the other threads but can't seem to find a solution to my problem.I start off with an object array, each specifying a 'start' and 'end' number. I loop through the difference between these, creating a new object from each number in between, storing the 'name' data in each new object created. After which, I would like to sort the data based off the number, but maintaining the placement order of the original array.const data = [{ 'start': 10, 'finish': 14, 'name': 'one'}, { 'start': 14, 'finish': 19, 'name': 'two'}, { 'start': 12, 'finish': 16, 'name': 'three'}]let newData = [];for (let d of data) { const start = d.start; const finish = d.finish;  for (let i = start; i &lt;= finish; i++) { newData.push({ 'number': i, 'name': d.name }) }}const sortData = (data) =&gt; newData.sort((a, b) =&gt; a.number - b.number)const result = sortData(data)// Test order for number 14for(let r of result){ if(r['number'] == 14){ console.log(r.name) }}// Show all dataconsole.log(result)Sorry for the long snippet, but it's difficult for me to display the problem.At the moment, when looking for the items with the number '14' after the sort, the names displayed are 'two, three, one'. I would like to instead maintain the original order of the 'data' array, so it should display as 'one, two, three'.I'm not sure how sort() is deciding what goes where, because if I change the second object's finish number to 17 inside the original data array it will display the items for number '14' in the correct order.Just to repeat - I would like to sort the newData array by the number but placed in the order of the original 'data' array.

Can I give R's approx() a parameter to interpolate by a minimum distance of the interpolated points?,|I have spatial data points with x-y-coordinates. They represent the banks of a channel. Now, I need to make this channel bank line to be denser. I want to linearly interpolate the bank points by giving a minimum distance in meters that all interpolated points must have to each other.For example: the blue points are the original points. The red are the interpolated points. They are all at least 1 m apart from each other. The lower right two blue points do not receive an interpolation. How can I achieve this?EDITDownvoting questions seems to be SO new hobby. What can I do to make you guys happy? My efforts?Currently I'm doing it with a loop. Which is slow but works. The suggestion by G5W is working! However, it does not incorporate the blue dots in the orange dots. Of course I can add the blue dots later to the interpolated orange ones. But I need the order of the dots intact for later processing.Since I think G5W is an expert in R, I don't think that there is a one-line-command to do this. Thus, I stick to loop I have. Here is a plot of the timing (I performed 10 runs to do the boxplots):Note: The absolute run time is decreased here, since I set the minimum distance quite high.|,<r>
Does a dataset need to be a normal distribution for every parameter?,|Sorry, I have just started machine learning and am not by any means an expert in it. So, most likely this question will sound ignorant which I am afraid that I cannot avoid. Also, I searched to the best of my ability and was incapable of finding similar questions or answers that may address my question.I learned that a model cannot learn if it was not from a dataset that has a normal distribution. Also, the only way I use to find out that a data set is normally distributed is the graphical method described here for each parameter. Which may be unadvisable, and if so I am always subject to change, so please correct me if that is the case. To get to my question, if I see a normal distribution for certain parametersyet not for a few others, does that mean the dataset is flawed? Or does it mean that I should not use those parameters for the model? Thanks in advance, and sorry if there are any fundamental errors in my understanding of the concepts.|,<machine-learning>

Up to here every thing works well. The problem is that I cannot return the response from the success or error callback. It must be assigned to a variable. and after error call back I can return the variable. Also if I use a simple variable it destroys my variable after assigning and the variable become undefined after callbacks. I have to define a variable as an object and then assign the response to a property of this object.Here is my Code:,<javascript><angularjs>

|Test a Class based Django View with RequestFactory, middleware, session and template context processor|,|I've a couple of views that are used as a mixin for other views. I want to test them by using a RequestFactory as the mixin themselves don't have a urlconf and I want to test some cornercases also. As the webapp uses all kinds of extra context in the form of Template Context Processors to determine how to render the templates I need the info in the template context processors also. The below code uses a simplified setup where I only use a template context processor version that could be used in a template like this {{ version }}. The templates would display certain info based on the version, which I would like to assert. After investigating I managed to get it working like this. The code uses py.test fixtures and py.test runner:Just to be complete here is the same thing as a normal Django TestCase:Is there a way to add the extra context, normally provided, by the template context processors; without having to manually add it to response.context_data?|,<django><unit-testing><templates>

Making Django forms return forms.instance in templates,|I have complex user-defined permissions for my users.

Remove rows where all variables are NA using dplyr,|I'm having some issues with a seemingly simple task: to remove all rows where all variables are NA using dplyr.

I guess one could do it by using filter_ and first creating a string with the (long) logical statement, but it seems like there should be a simpler way.Another way is to use rowwise() and do():but that does not look too nice, although it gets the job done.

What is the downside of using difference lists in an append operation in Prolog?,|This is a follow-up question to this question about difference lists.Generally, append/3 or conc/3 is written as follows:The downside of this recursion is that it doesn't run efficiently when taking a long list as first argument because the whole list needs to be processed before the actual appending can begin.To make this more efficient, we can use different lists which only requires variable instantiation and no recursion to append lists.The thing is that wherever I am looking for definitions of the append/3 predicate, the former is used, and not the supposedly more efficient alternative. Why is that? What is the downside of working with difference lists, and don't they justify the efficiency gain?|,<performance><list><recursion><prolog>

Mechansims for Collecting Cloud watch logs,|I am new to AWS, my requirement is to collect the VPC flow logs.

From S3 Bucket I have to read the data.Using LAMBDA function, we can subscribe LAMBDA function with log groups.

Liquibase 2.0.5 changesets failing for unknown reason,I am working on a project with a lot of old code. Sadly the technologies used haven't been updated fom ages. So some time ago me and my co worker we got new laptops and after we set up our project around 40 changests failed when deploying the project. Most of these changesets are not even written by us and they have been in the system for more than 3 years and have not been altered by us in any way. Also they appear to be pretty random here are some examples:We were previously using locally Postgresql 9.3.9 but now I am with version 9.5.5. But the version is not the problem cause I have other co workers with version 9.5.5 and for them the changests are not failing. This is exactly the problem cause now if I update the system the changesets fail and if they update after that they have to fix them again and so on and so on. We are using the same branch the same Postgesql version and our liquibase is 2.0.5. Please if anyone have any idea why these changesets are failing any help will be appreciated!,<liquibase>

E.g. launch your application with a -D argument (remember to put it before the main class or jar archive):  $ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=production demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  In Spring Boot you can also set the active profile in application.properties, e.g.  spring.profiles.active=production  A value set this way is replaced by the System property or environment variable setting, but not by the SpringApplicationBuilder.profiles() method. Thus the latter Java API can be used to augment the profiles without changing the defaults.|,<java><spring><tomcat><groovy><build.gradle>

mipi csi2 can not receive data correctly! error on capturing video with ov9724 camera and imx6dl microcontroller,|I am trying to interface omnivision's ov9724 camera with imx6dl microcontroller. The camera has only mipi interface with a single lane, and I am using only one lane for communication (one differential data lane and a differential clock lane). I ported the camera driver for ov5640 in "git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git". Since the camera only has RAW-10 bit output, I edited the code based on a reference code I found online.This is the relevant dts configuration I have edited.I am attaching the error log below. It looks like a clock issue to me, as referring to the errors, I find that these two bits are set according to the datasheet in Error register 1.Bit 4: Error matching Frame Start with Frame End for Virtual Channel 0Bit 28: Header ECC contains 2 errors. Unrecoverable.I have configured the imx to use IPU - 1, CSI - 0, Virtual Channel - 0 and Number of lanes - 1. Please refer to the log below.I think it might be something to do with the clock configuration but I am unsure how to go forward. I saw the dphy register settings mentioned in the "Debug Steps for customer MIPI Sensor" doc, which I think the author created based on the info available in document AN5305 (Page 14), which I am attaching here.I configured the clock as follows.In the camera sensor side according to the datasheet,  Pixel clk = (ext_clk * pll_multiplier) / (sys_clk_div_pll * pre_pll_clk_div_pll * pix_clk_div_pll) = (24000000 * 0x3E) / (0x0A * 0x01 * 0x02)  = 75.6 MHz.Now for configuring the mipi dphy clock on the imx side, I used the following calculation. (For 1280 x 720 at 30 fps)(This calculation is based on the equations in AN5305 doc attached here, Section 3.4, Page 13).Pixel clock = 1280 * 720 * 30 fps * 1 cycle/pixel * 1.35 blanking interval = 74.6 MHzTotal MIPI Data rate = 74.6 * 10 bits = 746 Mbps.For a 1 lane interface,  MIPI clock = 746 / (Number of lanes ) / 2 = 746 / 1 / 2 = 373 MHz.MIPI_CSI2_PHY_TST_CTRL1 setting = 373 MHz * 2 (DDR mode) = 746 MHzBased on this value, i edited the mipi dphy settings as follows in mxc_mipi_csi2.c by referring to AN5305 page 14.I am still not sure the clock settings are correct. I am also unclear as to the clock settings for ov5640 mentioned in AN5305 Page 21. (I have attached it as an image here - MIPI CLK setting in AN5305.png). Why are they setting the PLL5 to 596 MHz? Also, the ipu and mipi configs are as below.I printed the "dphy_clk", "pixel_clk", and "cfg_clk" as shown below. sh-4.3# dmesg || grep clkI saw that the pixel clk has been rounded to 30919000. I did not understand this part. Here the dphy_clk is 198 MHz. Do I have to change any extra pll settings or something? KERNEL DEBUG LOG SHOWING MIPI ERRORI am unable to probe the clk and data lines as the DSO I have is only of 200 MHz. The waveforms I did observe I have attached below. (Yellow probe - DATA_P, Green probe - DATA_N, Blue - CLK_P, Pink - CLK_N). I am observing data on the data lines when turning on the streaming, but did not see anything on the clock line initially. Then when I decreased voltage division of clock lines to 100mV (data voltage is around 1 V), then I saw a waveform pattern in the clock, which looked like noise initially. Seems like clock is present when the data is present. But when I probe both the data lines, clock lines look like noise as shown in fig scope_15.bmp. I do not know why the clock is behaving as such - HARDWARE ISSUE? But in the imx side, a ddr clock is detected as per the MPHY MIPI CSI2 PHY_STATE register.I know this is a long post, but I wanted to include everything I have done till date. I am a newbie to linux, and basically this is my first project. I will summarize my questions below.What could be the reason for the MIPI CSI error seen in the log? Does the clock in the waveforms look normal? Is it adequate for the mipi interface to work? In case my dphy clock configuration is wrong, how to configure both imx and the camera clock? More importantly, how is the camera sensor clock related to the dphyclock? In the document AN5605 page 21, what is the significance of the Clock 596MHz and what is the clock I should use?Please let me know your thoughts.Link to the AN5305 document- scope_2.bmp|,<android><c><linux-kernel><camera><imx6>

Specify percentage instead of time to ffmpeg,|To get a thumbnail from an image halfway through the video I can do ffmpeg -ss 100 -i /tmp/video.mp4 -frames:v 1 -s 200x100 image.jpg. By using -ss 100 it gets a thumbnail at 100 seconds (which would be halfway through the video assuming the video is 200 seconds long).But if I don't know the exact length of the video, in my application code I would need to use something like ffprobe to first determine the length of the video, and then divide it by 2 to get the thumbnail time.Is there a way to get ffmpeg to get the thumbnail at the percentage of the video you want? So instead of specifying -ss 100, something like -ss 50% or -ss 20% to get a thumbnail from halfway or 20% into the file?I know I can do this through application code, but it would be more efficient if there's a way for ffmpeg to handle this itself.|,<image><video><image-processing><ffmpeg><thumbnails>

How to install an application in Hadoop Cluster using YARN?,|I am trying to learn YARN. But I have hit a roadblock.I have some questions.For every application, the data nodes must have a container each.  But, are these containers created on their own, while running an application or do we need to create them?In dockers, you can access the containers, which behave as separate machines themselves. Can we access the containers similar way?In dockers, a container cannot see outside the container and behaves as a system of its own due to which it has container process id and from the host machine it has a process id as well. In other words, the containers are isolated from the other processes. Is there a similar concept in YARN as well?Thanks in Advance!!! :)|,<docker><containers><yarn><hadoop2><cgroups>

Maven different local repositories for SNAPSHOTs and RELEASE artifacts,|is it possible in Maven to configure different local repositories for SNAPSHOT and RELEASE artifacts?The reason I am asking, we are using Jenkins for continuous build for our project. To ensure the consistency (if same artifact is built from different Jenkins jobs because of race condition, we can experience chaotic behavior) before build start, we create a fresh local repository for Jenkins.Now the problem is, our project is huge, so for every build we have to download lots of dependencies from our Nexus but when you think about it, there is no reason to download every time new the RELEASE artifacts. The RELEASE artifacts don't change from build to build, for ex, Spring 4.5, httpclient 4.0, aspectj 1.8.1 is same for one build to another.So actually to ensure the consistency, we only should not have the SNAPSHOT dependencies in the repository. If we could have two local repositories one for RELEASE artifacts and the other for SNAPSHOT's, then before every build start, we could delete the SNAPSHOT repository but re-use the local RELEASE repository, which would save me gigabytes of download from Nexus.I know we can do RELEASE, SNAPSHOT configurations for remote repositories, is it possible to do same sort of configuration for local repositories?If this is not possible, how would you solve this problem.|,<maven><jenkins><maven-3>

React: Delay rendering of JSON data?,|I have the following React class. At first, the console will print an empty array {}, which will return the empty div. However, half a second later the console will print the correct values - but the empty div remains. How should I change the class to properly load the JSON?If I go to the console, the console.info prints an empty JSON string {} initially, which correctly returns the "loading names table..." div. However, data is printed in the console half a second later, but it never proceeds to go out of the if statement and populate the table.It works if I change the nameTable var to include "manual" data, so it must be something with rendering the server-side data that's delayed half a second.How could I change the above class to delay rendering for, say, 1 second and then populate the table? It would work in that case I suspect. Removing the if statement results in Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object in the console, which makes sense since the string is indeed empty for half a second. |,<javascript><arrays><json><reactjs>

Calling a shiny JavaScript Callback from within a future,|In shiny, it is possible to call client-side callbacks written in javascript from the server's logic. Say in ui.R you have some JavaScript including a function called setText:then in your server.R you can call session$sendCustomMessage(type='foo', 'foo'). Suppose I have a long-running function which returns some data to plot. If I do this normally, the R thread is busy while running this function, and so can't handle additional requests in this time. It would be really useful to be able to run this function using the futures package, so that it runs asynchronously to the code, and call the callback asyncronously. However, when I tried this is just didn't seem to work. Sorry if this isn't very clear. As a simple example, the following should work until you uncomment the two lines trying to invoke future in server.R. Once those lines are uncommented, the callback never gets called. Obviously it's not actually useful in the context of this example, but I think it would be very useful in general.ui.R:server.R:|,<r><callback><shiny><future>

Using long running Cron Jobs with Prestashop and Cloudflare CDN,So I've got Cloudflare and Prestashop running together to improve load times however a side effect of the CDN is that my cronjobs can only run for a maximum of 90 seconds. Any longer and Cloudflare will send out a 524 error and the cronjob will not be properly launched.According to Cloudflare there are two ways to get around this problem. I can either reduce the size of the cronjob process so it fits within the 90 second window (which is not an option) or I can run the cronjobs on a separate subdomain that Cloudflare has no effect on. The problem with this option however is that Prestashop has something built into it so that regardless of what subdomain you use to visit the site it simply redirects to the main domain.Does anyone have experience with this kind of issue and if so what are the best methods of getting around the problem.

Connect to external services inside Visual Studio Online build/test task,|We are running our build and test process on TFS Online. This works fine, until we try to connect to an external service. In our case a SQL Database.The discussion about what we should mock and not is not really helpful in this case, as currently we need to do this.We also tried just a simple ping, but not even that is getting out:So we have the impression that most outside IP's/Ports/etc. could be locked?Is there a way to open this up? If yes, how?I can't imagine that we are the first ones to try something like that? Downloading something from a website, making a REST all, etc? Should be possible somehow, no?Update 1:We had a bit a more detailed question about this issue here, but figured it was a more generic problem. The error message when we connect to Azure SQL is But the Named Pipes Provider part is missleading. You also get this message locally if you try to connect to an IP that does not exist.We access Azure SQL from our C# NUnit tests.Update 2:We tried out the idea from @starain-MSFT and installed the Azure SQL Execute Query step/task. Installation works fine, but it seems to miss a component. See picture below.  No agent could be found with the following capabilities: azureps, sqlps, npm, node.js, msbuild, visualstudio, vstestBased on installed apps list I assume it's azureps.Solution (partly):Ok, so we went down the wrong route all the way. The problem is not the firewall (or any firewalls for that matter). The problem was that our app.config file didn't had the right settings in it.We had the same setup for our App.config files inside the unit tests as for our Web.config files. Each had a App.Debug.config and a App.Release.config file attached. While this worked fine for the web applications, this obviously didn't work for our unit tests.We are still looking for a good solution here. I found this solution on how to add a transform task inside Visual Studio, but this is not exactly what we are searching, because we don't need the transform locally, but only in Visual Studio Teams.app.config Transform inside Visual Studio TeamsSo, I think we finally got it. With ConfigTransform, we can now transform our app.config files during the build process. |,<visual-studio><tfs><vs-team-services><tfsbuild>
Implementing an Iterative Single Stack Binary Tree Copy Function,|As a thought exercise I am trying to implement an iterative tree (binary or binary search tree) copy function.It is my understanding that it can be achieved trivially:with a single stackwithout using a wrapper (that contains references to the copy and original nodes)without a node having a reference to it's parent (would a parent reference in a node be counter to a true definition of a tree [which I believe is a DAG]?)I have written different implementations that meet the inverse of the above constraints but I am uncertain how to approach the problem with the constraints. I did not see anything in Algorithms 4/e and have not seen anything online (beyond statements of how trivial it is). I considered using the concepts from in order and post order of a current/previous var but I did not see a way to track accurately when popping the stack. I also briefly considered a hash map but I feel this is still just extra storage like the extra stack.Any help in understanding the concepts/idioms behind the approach that I am not seeing is gratefully received.Thanks in advance.Edit:Some requests for what I've tried so far. Here is the 2 stack solution which I believe is supposed to be able to turn into the 1 stack the most trivially.It's written in C++. I am new to the language (but not programming) and teaching myself using C++ Primer 5/e (Lippman, Lajole, Moo) [C++11] and the internet. If any of the code from a language perspective is wrong, please let me know (although I'm aware Code Review Stack Exchange is the place for an actual review).I have a template Node that is used by other parts of the code.And then the 2 stack implementation.|,<algorithm><data-structures><binary-tree><binary-search-tree>

However my concern is that the root password on our device is actually a fairly simple one. The devices themselves have rather limited functionality so not much someone could do if they got on it themselves, however if they got on the device they could upgrade theirs and anyone else's device if they so desired.So my question is, how could I best 'hide' the password in my script so it's not easily searchable by anyone with a decomplier?Right now the code is simply,So I'd like to hide the password somewhere, but I can't think of a method that means someone with a decompiler couldn't just open up the exe and look for where the password is, or how I derive it from somtething else...|,<c#><security><ssh><passwords>

Why the erlang periodic process execution time is varying drastically over time,|In my application there are three erlang processes which run periodically at an interval of 10ms, 1s and 5s, let's call them as process A, B and C respectively; and there are two c-nodes, X and Y which perform some low level hardware access.The c-nodes has a fixed pool of linux thread to serve the queries received from the erlang process simultaneously. One erlang process can send only one query to a c-node as the calls are blocking, but the c-nodes can receive multiple calls from different erlang process and serve them simultaneously through it's fixed pool of threads. In my application process A and C are using the service of c-node X, and process is B using the service of c-node Y.We observed that the execution time of all the three erlang processes are varying drastically over time, i.e. to start with process A, B and C is completing their task in 3ms, 100ms and 250ms respectively, but over a period of an hour it is increasing to 200ms, 600ms, 1300ms, then again it is coming down slowly to 3ms, 100ms and 250ms, and as we continue to run we are seeing this pattern repetitively.I have also implemented the same erlang process logic in C application, there I do not see this issues.What could be the possible explanation behind this slow down pattern, and what would be the right way to benchmark or profile this behaviour?|,<process><erlang>

Use Service Bus as a push notification workaround (excluding Notification Hub),|I'm developing an on-site WinRT application and would like to send push notifications when a new update is available (since it's an on-site app, the installation process requires a custom loader rather than the Windows Store app).However, I'm trying to wrap my head around how such a system should ideally function.I could obviously create a service which returns the latest version number and the app would periodically poll the service for that info. It would be easy to implement, but it seems like a very ugly approach (the need to send constant requests for the latest version doesn't seem like an elegant one).I have the power of Azure at my disposal. Obviously a Notification Hub would be the preferred way. HOWEVER, I have no intention of getting a Windows Store account purely to develop a "private" on-site application. So using the Notification Hub is a no-go.I've thought about using topics. This WOULD work, but every client would probably need to be added as a subscriber. While technically possible, the administrative overhead could be a major issue. I also thought about creating the subscribers dynamically by the WinRT application itself. However the SDK (Azure Messaging Managed) for handling this is too old and always throws an error (invalid date format, which apparently was changed at some point) when creating subscribers. The only "current" package from MS seems to be for the full .NET framework, not the limited WinRT counterpart.I'm looking for ways around this problem. Either a newer, proper SDK (which can handle listing and creating subscriptions as well as receiving topic), or perhaps a completely different approach to the problem.Note - I don't need any code just yet. Pseudocode or simply a description on how the communication would work should suffice.|,<push-notification><servicebus>

Android Webview caret disappears,|I am in the process of testing a hybrid app for Android 4.4+. The app consists of one custom plugin (my own effort)the HTML UI created using Phonon.Phonegap CLI v 6.4.2My test device is a Huwaei Holly running Android 4.4.2One of the issues I have run into is the fact that the caret in textarea and input controls stops working "after a while" and the soft keyboard does not popup when I tap the control.By dint of some trial and error I pinned down the problem - it happens AFTER the app has displayed at least one vanilla HTML/JS alert box which I am using for my own debugging needs. Replacing that with a Phonon.alert box - which is simply an overlayed layer of HTML, not a new window as, I imagine, the bog standard alert is - "fixed" the problem.Very good but the fact that this happens at all still bothers me - I will not use vanilla alerts in my release build but if it happened with alerts it might well happen with something else.A spot of Googling revealed that is a known issue that appears to have been around for a while. This SO thread, for instance, suggests the Webview has to be set as being focussable and I have run into the same suggestion elsewhere too.However, it is not at all clear to me just where I should do this. About the only configuration locations I have at my disposal areThe config.xml file for my Phonegap/Cordova projectThe plugin.xml file for my custom Phonegap/Cordova pluginThe Phonegap docs related to config.xml do not mention anything about FrameworkLayout, android:focussable etc.I'd be most grateful to anyone who might be able to eitherexplain just where the android:focussable bit should go orsuggest the root cause of the problem.|,<android><html5><cordova><android-webview><caret>

Cross-platform USB communication using ASP.NET Core,|OverviewI've ported a web application to .NET Core and I'm finding that it's able to communicate with a microcontroller over USB when running on Windows but not when running on Linux. I'm trying to work out:Why this is the case (is it a bug in the libraries I'm using, or have I misconfigured the Linux environment?)How I can resolve or work around it (alternative libraries, changes to environment, etc.)If anyone has successfully managed to create an application based on .NET Core that can communicate over USB in a platform-agnostic manner, I'd be very grateful for your input.EnvironmentFor reference in the remainder of this post, these are some of the details about my current environment:Windows 7 64-bit host machineDotnet version 1.0.0-preview2-003131Docker version 1.12.0, build 8eab29eDocker Toolbox (I believe v1.12.3)VirtualBox v5.0.30 r112061DetailsI formerly had a .NET Framework-based web service that I was using to control a microcontroller. Being based on the .NET Framework, it was restricted to running on Windows. In order to achieve cross-platform support I began porting the application to .NET Core. That task is now more-or-less complete - for instance, I can now build and run my application as a Docker service which I imagine will be of great benefit.My application is split across multiple projects, but for the purpose of this post I'll only address two:The ASP.NET Core-based web service project which adapts the core functionality of the application to be controllable via web communication. 1 It ties everything else together and is what I actually execute using dotnet &lt;&lt;application.dll&gt;&gt;.A USB communications service project which handles communication with my USB device. 2 It currently uses the CoreCompat.LibUsbDotNet library (v2.2.8-r101), which acts as a cross-platform C# adapter over the WinUSB and libusb libraries on Windows and Unix respectively. This project is distributed as a Nuget package that's consumed by the web service, and is where the problem lies.The application runs fine when I run it directly under Windows. However, if I try to run it on a Linux virtual machine or as a Docker service, the web service will fail to initialise with an error complaining that the libusb-1.0 library could not be located. 3Based on this error message, I've tried inspecting the environment of both the Linux VMs and Docker containers that I've attempted running the application on. 4After mounting my USB device on the Docker virtual machine and running a container based off my web app image in privileged mode, I can confirm that it sees my USB device:root@19e8929e1814:/app# lsusbBus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hubBus 001 Device 002: ID 2b87:0001Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hubI also confirm that libusb-1.0 is installed 5 and check that it's available from the ldconfig cache:root@19e8929e1814:/app# ldconfig -p || grep libusblibusb-1.0.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) =&gt; /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.so.0libusb-1.0.so (libc6,x86-64) =&gt; /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-1.0.solibusb-0.1.so.4 (libc6,x86-64) =&gt; /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-0.1.so.4libusb-0.1.so.4 (libc6,x86-64) =&gt; /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libusb-0.1.so.4Based on this, I'm not sure why CoreCompat.LibUsbDotNet throws an exception about not being able to find libusb-1.0, and can only assume it's a bug in the library.Has anyone successfully managed to use this library for communication under a Unix environment?

Zoom UIImageView to fill UIScrollView on the tap of a button (Similar to instagram),|I have an ImageView placed inside of a UIScrollView which can zoom in and out on the image. I also have a button that I want to be able to toggle the zoom from the minimum zoom scale to zoom the image to fill the bounds of the UIScrollView. You can easily do this by changing the content mode of the ImageView from UIScaleAspectFit to UIScaleAspectFill. However, I would also want to be able to zoom out again to the minimum zoom scale by pinching the screen. This doesn't seem possible by just changing the content mode of the ImageView because the zoom scale jumps, it needs to be smooth. The functionality I want is the same as Instagram's image tool(Well, just the zooming anyways).This seems like a non-trivial problem, because when I load in the Image I set the ImageView frame to be the same as the ScrollView so it will fit in the view nicely, but I then have the issue of the content size of the ImageView and the ScrollView being the same so I am not sure on how to figure out the correct zoom scale.Note: Answers in Objective-C will also be accepted |,<c#><ios><uiscrollview><xamarin.ios><uiimageview>

Weird BitBlt in TThread memory leak,|I have a simple program which takes screenshots of the screen a few times per second.

I can even hold Enter key on the first button and there is no memory leak but when I click the second button the thread instantly keeps rising the memory usage (I can even stop it using stop_thread variable but the memory usage stays high).I know the problem has something to do with the BitBlt line, because without it there is no memory leak.

Create Excel graph with multiple data sources for a line graph in C#,|Using the excel COM api from Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel, I want to create a Excel table with line graph.

Opinions on improving efficiency of Excel task,|I have relatively small data set (circa 5mb) which I need to download (paid subscription) and sort on a monthly basis. I am hoping that someone can indicate a more efficient way to tackle this task.The data is a record of planning applications within the last 30 days and whist the data is very informative, it is not organised very well - i.e. they do not provide the use type (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial etc.) nor do they provide the number of units. But they do provide a title for the application as well as a description. An example title as follows:  STACKVILLE - 1680 APARTMENTS/RESTAURANT/RETAIL UNITSAn example description as follows:  Independent living scheme for older persons comprising 1100 one and 580 two bedroom apartments with support facilities a restaurant and bar retail units a cafe 20 reablement suites parking access landscaping and demolition works. 1 568 sq.mAt present, I am using Excel which is somewhat time consuming. I have an ever-growing list of circa 100 use classes, as I need to determine the exact usage, which I search the title and description for. If both the title and description return the same value then I am reasonably certain that is the use classification, if it is not found it is unlikely to be of interest - although I am not 100% certain my method catches everything that I am asking it to. If they return different values then I have to do a bit of manual sift. The formula I am using as follows: After I have determined them I then need to determine the number of units and put this figure into a column to the right of the data for analysis. Can anyone recommend a more efficient way to do this? I'm currently learning Python if that helps.

Why does PHP allow abstract static functions,|Consider the following code:The PhpStorm IDE puts a warning on the declaration of abstractStaticFunction that reads: PHP Strict Standards: Static function 'abstractStaticFunction' should not be abstract.  Static function should not be abstract.However, PHP continues program execution when parsing this class and outputs the following: PHP Strict standards: Static function ExampleClass::abstractStaticFunction() should not be abstract in php shell code on line 7It seems to me that because PHP allows static function calls on abstract classes, defining an abstract static function on an abstract class should not be possible.Why are abstract static functions allowed in PHP by the interpreter?|,<php><abstract-class><interpreter><abstract-function>

Joomla 3.6 component and php code,I'm hoping someone can help me with this as I've burnt away many hours trying to find a solution?I'm working on a Joomla 3.6.5 website using a component called OS Services Booking by OS SOLUTION.I have the component configured as I would like and working (to a point) on a test server whilst I attempt to configure with WorldPay as the Payment Gateway for bookings.The problem I am experiencing is that once a payment has been processed through WorldPay the "shopper response" (or redirect) only appears to be working so far until it experiences a 303 error and hangs.I believe the reason for this 303 error is due to how the response from WorldPay is handled once it reaches the OS Services Booking component.The shopper response url that is provided by the component and you put in your WorldPay configuration is - From what I understand this is the URL that WorldPay passes the results of the transaction back to. The data sent back from WorldPay reaches OS Services booking and as a result the component updates its database to log the transaction / book out the timeslot and send notification emails.The last part of the process is for the component to redirect you to a page on your website informing the customer that the transaction has failed / succeeded.To do this the component passes variables to create the url (this all appears to happen in the file... components > com_osservicesbooking > helpers > payment > omnipay.php starting around line 135)I've traced the url (using wheregoes.com) and the way that the component handles this function appears to be via a 303 Redirect.WorldPay doesn't appear to like this 303 Redirect and everything then stops and the customer is left hanging on WorldPays webpage (i believe they are called resultsY.html or resultsC.html rather than being redirected back to your website! After researching and speaking with it seems that WorldPay might pass this Url redirect if the route taken uses a Meta Refresh rather than the 303 redirect.With that in mind I am hopeful that if the code can be edited to perform a Meta Refresh then everything might work?Something like (my PHP skills are none existent)(But that doesn't work!) If ANYONE can help it would be very much appreciated,<php><redirect><joomla><url-routing><worldpay>

Spark SQL using Python: Unable to instantiate org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.SessionHiveMetaStoreClient,|I want to test basic stuff with Spark SQL.

I use iPython Notebook as a User Interface.My code is as follows:The problem lies in Spark SQL since I can load the same file using If I want to run an example from the Spark SQL documentation https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html I get the same error.I was under the impression that I can use Spark SQL without using Hive, since the data I am using is saved localy on my laptop. Furthermore the same documentation as above implies just that:"One use of Spark SQL is to execute SQL queries. Spark SQL can also be used to read data from an existing Hive installation. For more on how to configure this feature, please refer to the Hive Tables section." And there are also examples of creating a spark session using Hive. So the one above would be useless, if using hive was mandatory.However, I wanted to configure Hive to see if this solves the problem. The documentation guide (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#hive-tables) states "Configuration of Hive is done by placing your hive-site.xml , core-site.xml (for security configuration), and hdfs-site.xml (for HDFS configuration) file in conf/."I could not find those documents, though.So my questions are these:Do I need Hive for using Spark SQL? If not, what can I do to get Spark SQL working? If yes, how can I configure it correcty and were can I findthose files needed?Any help is appreciated!

User Access to Google Storage files by Android and App Engine app,|We have two apps: one Android app and one App Engine app. In both apps the user has to sign in with his Google account.The user can upload images to his Google Storage bucket and we thought we have to set up ACL settings for correct permission control.

MariaDB/ mySQL grouping nested SQL results doesn't work as in MSSQL?,|I think I do not understand how nested queries in MariaDB (/mySQL) get resolved.This query works as expected in MSSql, but not in MariaDB:I want to group timed events into 'slots' of 5 seconds.

The field 'time_grouped' only holds values being multiples of 5, i.e. ending with 0 or 5. => Works fine.Now I want to group the resulting data by this value, ie I want to to find the minimum distance of a mac in a 5-sec slot. Obviously all values of V.time_grouped again should be multiples of 5. => They are not.So I think that the query optimizer doesn't handle my query in the expected way.(I use those kind of queries frequently (and successfully) in MSSql)Q: How can I provide the desired result?Redirections to suitable Documentation appreciated (so far I found docs only about other aspects of nesting, which do seem to relate to my question).[Edit]Attached see sample data of the inner select. The marked values in time_grouped are supposed to get grouped, the min(distance) to remain as value.(Of course the not-marked rows will remain as well.)So instead of 26 rows the result set should contain 15 rows.|,<mysql><sql><nested><mariadb>

Port specification on an asio tcp client application,|I'm rewriting a python twisted server in C++ using asio. I have set up the following examples from:Daytime.1 - A synchronous TCP daytime clientDaytime.3 - An asynchronous TCP daytime server and they seem to be functioning correctly. However, what is puzzling me is that when I created the twisted server both it and the client side required explicit specification of the IP addresses and port numbers. I am having a slightly different experience here:On the client application no specification of the port number is required. I can successfully connect to the server by using only 127.0.0.1 as a command line argument.Also, I appear to be able to connect to the same server with any legal variant of this IP address, as long as the first byte is 127 (eg 127.1.2.3 connects).There's a literal in the client code specifying to connect using what I assume is an OS provided "daytime" TCP service. However, there is no reference to this in the server code. Why do I have to specify a particular service to connect to? I also suspect that this service could be related to the behaviour in points 1 and 2.Now I know that the server has an acceptor socket listening that only establishes the connection once it receives a request but I would like some more details here.|,<tcp><boost-asio>

Figured it would be less stressful to get it working first before I go putting things in separate places trying to make sure they all link together properly lol.As I got to this point it hit me that I have no clue as to how to bind that data to the component. I started to tinker around for a second, but realized that the way I was attempting to do it would be binding it exclusively to that component, rather than being flexible.So far the answers aren't loading with it being like that, which is what led me to wondering if I'm even trying to do the right thing in the first place. I'm also unsure about my way of bind data to the attributes of the HTML tags.Aside from this, there's some javascript logic I'm going to be factoring in as well to toggle other questions and content on and off as the user selects certain answers.

Android Fast YUV420P to ARGB8888 Conversion,|I am using Android's MediaCodec API to decode H.264 encoded video data coming in from the network to do live streaming.I am aware that I can render the video to a view directly by configuring the decoder to operate in the Surface mode.However, by doing this, the output video exhibits color banding on certain platforms. The target platform with this issue is Android-x86 6.0 running on a Intel Celeron N2930 processor.After endless trials to fix the problem, I decided to use the decoder in what is known as the ByteBuffer mode. In this mode, I receive decoded video frames in ByteBuffers which store the color values of the frames' pixels.The output video frame is in YUV420p for my target platform that I mentioned above. To display the video frame onto a view, I must first convert it to a Bitmap. Before creating the bitmap, I should first convert the frame color format to ARGB8888.Initially I did this conversion in Java, but the process is too slow to be any useful for live streaming, about 300+ ms. Then I did the conversion using native C code. Managed to cut the time to about half, but still it is too slow for at least 20 fps on a 1920x1080 video.This function, which I obtained from somewhere here in SO, performs in blocks of 2x2 pixels in one iteration.How can I speed up this process?

SugarCRM mask fields in PDF,|I am being asked to review SugarCRM, because we would like to acquire a CRM system. One of the key requirements that we have is to be able to mask some fields when they are printed to PDF.We have a company service that is available and tells us in what case what field must be masked.The idea is for any PDF report, dynamically generated, we want to be able to chose to what format (masked or in clear) a field is printed to PDF.I have had a look at the (good) documentation here: and I understand it is do-able to override the pdf generation for some modules.What I cannot figure out, and is key to our project, is that if we can achieve this with the generic pdf generation (the scope is every generated PDF).I understand the data are being acquired by the PDFManager. Would it be possible to extend the PDFManager and use it for every report?Would a solution like this work?I am new to SugarCRM and php. I am mandated to understand the doability of this.Many thanks for your help.Gilles|,<pdf><pdf-generation><sugarcrm>

C++: std::vector with space reserving for both ends,|Just some thoughts:I wanted to erase x elements from the beginning of a std::vector with size n > x. Since a vector uses an array internally, this could be as easy as setting the pointer for vector.begin() to the index of the first element which is kept. But instead, erase shifts all elements in the array to that the first element actually starts at index 0, making the erase operation take much more time than it could.Furthermore, if the valid 'zone' of the internal array was really controlled by just some start and end indices / pointers of the vector structure, then there would be also the option to reserve space in front of the first element. E.g., a vector is initialized and 20 spaces are reserved at the end and 10 at the beginning. Internally, then an array of space 30 (or 32) is created, where the start index/pointer points to the 11th value of the internal array, allowing to include new elements to the front of the 'vector' in constant speed.Well, my point is, I think such a data structure would be somewhat useful, at least for my purposes. I'm pretty sure someone already thought of this and already implemented it. So I want to ask: How is the data structure called that I'm describing? If it exists, I'd love to use it. I think this is not a double-linked list, since there, every element is kind of a struct containing the element value and additional pointers to the neighbors (to my knowledge).EDIT: And yes, such a structure would probably use more memory than necessary, especially when erasing some elements from the beginning, because then, the internal array still has the initial size. But well, memory isn't a big issue anymore for most problems, and there could be a (time-expensive) 'memory-optimize' operation to create a new, smaller array, copying over all old values and deleting the old internal array to use the smallest possible size.|,<c++><arrays><vector><data-structures>

Iterating over *ngFor with a static array of objects constantly updates the DOM,|I have a simple component which iterates over a static array of objects and displays the content. When this component is added into the larger application, the content is displayed correctly but I am unable to register any click events on it. When I inspect the element in chrome using right click -&gt; Inspect I am greeted with the body tag and it doesn't drill down to the individual element as expected.By navigating manually, inspecting the element idicates that the component is constantly being updated by the DOM (div tag flashes). By my understanding there shouldn't be any change detected since it is a static array.Changing the object array to a simple string array ['a', 'b', 'c'] behaves as expected and the DOM isn't being updated.Adding additional elements the template outside of the ngFor are unaffected and aren't being constantly updated.I am using v2.4.1Simplified Componentimport { Component } from '@angular/core';@Component({ selector: 'app-ngfor-test', templateUrl: './ngfor-test.component.html', styleUrls: ['./ngfor-test.component.css']})export class NgforTestComponent {  get items() { return [ { 'label': 'a', 'value': 'first' }, { 'label': 'b', 'value': 'second' }, { 'label': 'c', 'value': 'third' } ]; }}&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.23/angular.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Template&lt;div class="item-container" *ngFor="let item of items"&gt; &lt;label&gt;{{ item.label || uppercase }}&lt;/label&gt; &lt;span&gt;{{ item.value }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;|,<angular2><typescript>

Transaction wrap around issue in Postgresql,|Our server is hosted on AWS and the database is RDS (Postgres). All of a sudden, the database stopped accepting commands. All the queries were taking forever and never completed. I tried killing some connection/queries and even that was not responsive. Since application updates the same tables at different times, they all got locked since the first update itself was stuck. I then realized this to be a transaction wrap around issue. My understanding is that database stops accepting any commands when the transaction id begins to reach the threshold for wrap around. Some details on the maintenance activities that is carried out on the database:The auto vacuum threshold is set at .01 which the table gets auto vacuumed when 1% of the table has dead tuples.I have nightly vacuum analyze job that vacuum analyzes all the tables in the entire database. This takes around 1 hour to complete.Some large transaction table tables that are frequently updated undergo a vacuum analyze every two hours.The database parameters for freeze vacuum didn't have any value.This transaction wrap around issue happened on a day we upgraded Postgres from 9.5 to 9.6. We missed the above maintenance activities on this day. But one day shouldn't be that big a deal i would think.Can somebody help understand the below questions:How does one detect transaction wrap around failure?What are the steps needed to be taken to avoid this?Some parameters related to freeze vacuum needs to be set? What are typical values for these setting or is there any math behind how to set these values?How do I solve when this issue happens? Any particular plans of action in order that i need to take will be helpful.Are there any other maintenance activities that will help but I am missing. Currently my maintenance activities only vacuum analyze tables.Why would transaction wrap around failure even happen when i regularly vacuum analyze tables? I am possibly missing the freeze vacuum analyze but don't clearly seem to understand the difference.|,<postgresql><database-administration><vacuum>

Django: cannot import name migrations,|I had an issue I just posted here. I saw an answer to a similar question which said uninstalling and installing requirements.txt would help because the root of the issue was a bad dependency chain.So I did that and now, of course, I ran into a new issue.When running the migrations, I am getting the following error:According to another answer, this is caused because I am using the migrations module, which my Django version (1.4) doesn't support yet.It seems like the django-generic-m2m module (version 0.3.1) is using migrations. I don't understand why this issue is happening now, as I have always used the same requirements.txt file and I never had this problem.I used to have similar problems with dependencies using migrations while my Django couldn't handle them. But these deps also had a south_migrations folder, so just renaming it to migrations and getting rid of the actual migrations folder would do the trick. However, I don't see any south_migrations directory in the generic2m2 installation dir.Has anybody had this issue before?|,<python><django><django-1.4>

Spring Integration Doubts: CRUD operations and sharing events between components,|I am currently developing a simple Spring web app using Spring integration framework. I have read about the enterprise integration patterns, purpose, benefits... I have get rid out of the ServiceLayer and delegated the app workflow to the integration framework. But I have come across some design issues where I am stuck and I would appreciate some light in terms of design. Here below I ll try to explain them, thanks in advance.1. CRUD operations with Spring Integration FrameworkLets say you have 2 endpoints connected through a direct channel, 1 endpoint receives requests and the other one processes those requests. I don't want to talk from the implementation perspective but from the design (as I have stated before) but in order to clarify it out, image that you implement the receiving endpoint as a RestController connected to a Gateway and the other endpoint as an ServiceActivator connected to a DB adapter.Now, there are 4 basic operations the user can request, Create, Read, Update and Delete (basic CRUD). Since the receiver endpoint can only execute one method (handleMessage method), what is the correct way to multiplex the 4 operations? Adding some kind of tag to the message header? It seems ugly to me and besides the receiver endpoint will have to implement a block of if-else. It would be easier to just connect the controller to an interface and call the methods and get rid of spring integration.Create 4 ServiceActivator connected to the same DB? I don't like it either, imagine if you had 30 operations instead of 4.Any other solution I have not found yet? For example, send each operation through a different channel, so that you would have 4 channels. You can do this from the Gateway point of view but the problem is that the ServiceActivator can only have 1 inbound channel.2. Sharing events between endpoints with Spring Integration FrameworkLets say you have a Gateway connected to a Transformer.The transformer inits a thread in which parses some data and send it to the next endpoint when finishes. Now, the Gateway client needs to know the status of the request it sent through the channel (since the Gateway knows nothing about the Transformer or its implementation they shouldn't share anything). How can be it accomplished since the transformer only has 1 inbound channel and 1 output channel and there is no way to publish results back through a third channel? In essence, the question is, how do you share event without coupling the endpoints or breaking the integration patterns architecture? P.D.:Please avoid no clean answers such as static shared objects, thanks.|,<java><spring><web-applications><spring-integration><integration>

What's the purpose of classes with empty constructor and no reference to DB,|I suspect this kind of question had already been asked but I couldn't find anything about it.Everytime I work on a new project I see code that is supposed to be following the last fancy rules about OOP, MVC or whatever but everytime I look at it it just seems to me that it violates even the very basics of the concept they brag about.For instance here I stumble on a class that represents a "station" with around 60 properties, but the only property expected by and set in the constructor is the ID, and this class has no access whatsoever to a DB from which it could get the information using the ID...So there are 60 setters, 60 getters and a bunch of other method.What is the point of this instead of receiving in the constructor an array containing all the information, or an ID and a reference to the DB which would still make the source of information flexible.Is it that "hydration" stuff and if so can you elaborate on the benefits of it ?As for now it just makes it harder for me to debug and locate the source of the datas.Thank you all for your time !|,<php><oop><hydration>

In React.js should I make my initial network request in componentWillMount or componentDidMount?,|In the react docs it recommends making initial network requests in the componentDidMount method: componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request. Setting state in this method will trigger a re-rendering.If componentWillMount is called before rendering the component, isn't it better to make the request and set the state here? If I do so in componentDidMount, the component is rendered, the request is made, the state is changed, then the component is re-rendered. Why isn't it better to make the request before anything is rendered?|,<javascript><reactjs>

Process external API responses in controllers,|In my app I work with external services' APIs. Let's say I'm trying to delete a Video at some Service by sending suitable request for that. (I give deleting as example, because creating and updating could be easily processed by using just @video.save and errors array).Let's How it works:User selects video and presses Delete buttonController gets video id and gets an object of Video class by (let's say) calling @video = Video.find(params[:id]). Then it calls @video.delete_video_at_service.In Video class it is defined a delete_video_at_service method that makes an API request to the Service and gets a response. As a response I can get several errors that means video was not deleted. And I should delete @video if it succeded or redirect user (or even show an alert to them) depending on an error code.The easiest way (and unfortunately the only way I clearly see) is to process it right in controller, somehow like this:But I'm sure it's the worst way I could do it. Also it's not the only place I need to process API response in that way (e.g. in DelayedJod) and I obviously do not want to write such processing every time I make API call.

Incompatibility between app instances: prevent rabbitmq to consume messages with particular header,|I have two instances of the same java application using spring and rabbitmq. An instance sends a message to a queue but I can't predict which instance will consume it (as expected).I updated the java application. For some reasons, the is no compatibility between the old and the new version: the new version can't consume the messages from the old one and vice versa.We can't offer disruption of service while deploying a new version, so we can't stop both instances at the same time. We have to stop instance A, restart instance A with updates, then stop B and restart it with updates.When I have the new instance of A and the old instance of B, A cannot consume the messages as expected if they were produced by B.To solve this, the idea was to add a header to the rabbitmq messages. I created a custom rabbitmq template:This adds a new header with the version of the application. Then I would like to check this header before ack a message.E.g.: A sends a message with version 4B receives the message -> does not consume nor ack because B version is 3.A receives the message -> consumes because A version is 4.Is such a configuration possible?I also had a look at @RabbitListener group properties but I am not sure what to do with this.Thanks for any help|,<java><spring><rabbitmq><spring-rabbit>

TFS 2015 Code Viewer Not Working in Google Chrome,|I found the following issue here in stackoverflow however cannot comment as yet. I have a similar issue and wonder if there is anyone out there that has solved it.TFS 2015 Web Portal Code Viewer not workingI am encountering similar here. In house TFS 2015, can't view code in the web portal using Google Chrome however IE is fine. I, however, am not using HTTPS so may be experiencing something slightly different.When I do try to view a file in Chrome, the window where the code listing should be is simply blank. I did note too that the button for creating a new build definition appears to be indicating a broken image link.This has not always been an issue. Around 4 months ago I could get the code view fine in Chrome and, to my knowledge as I have no access to the servers, nothing has changed apart from Chrome updates.I've tried getting to previous versions of Chrome to no avail, though I wouldn't know which version I was on when this did work.Interestingly, I have one or two .MD files around and these display perfectly well. They are simple text files. However when saved with .TXT extension (or anything else I've tried), they do not show. Curious.UpdateAs you will see from the screenshot below, when selection on a file has been made, in this case a .SQL file, where I would expect the view to populate nothing at all appears.As for the F12, I do get 5 of these:Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSEDplus associated paths of course. We use Webroot internally here which has recently dropped in a Chrome extension however even when Webroot is disabled in its entirety (including removal of extension) I get the same behaviour.All other Chrome extensions have been removed too at varying times to try to give a clean browser.I have no other pop up blockers, ad blockers, etc installed on the workstation.|,<google-chrome><tfs>
changing css background with javascript not working,|Just as a heads up, I'm new to javascript...I'm trying to do the following:HTML: Got a &lt;body id="example&gt; and a hidden counter &lt;input id="counter" value="1"&gt;and the following javascript (passing 1 or -1 thru the function):I can't seem to get the background to change to the next image in the folder I'm pointing to from "exampleImg1" to "exampleImg2" and so on.I tested this with an alert(newBgImage) to make sure I was escaping my quotes properly and I am, or at least I think so (Also, this tells me it's breaking down at the last line of code). I know I can do this by changing class names instead and have separate classes in the CSS but my CSS would be a lot cleaner doing it this way AND I tested that just to see and it wouldn't even update style.className.Not sure what what's going wrong.|,<javascript><styles>
